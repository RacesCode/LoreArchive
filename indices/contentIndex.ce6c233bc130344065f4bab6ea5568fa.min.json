{"/":{"title":"Race's Lore Vault","content":"\nHey, this is my little project of creating a public story a bit at a time, all connected with pieces of lore and in episodic/entry novel form. When I started this I was very new to this concept and writing in general, often finishing an entry in only a few minutes to publish as an alert to my streams (mistake). There are varying degrees of quality at the beginning (I’ve removed a lot) but the more it’s gone on the more I love how far I’ve come with it.\n\nCurrently reworking some of the earlier entries, feel free to dive into a few of the chained stories to get a feel for continuing stories and characters. Thanks for reading :) \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.113265897Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0011":{"title":"0011","content":"**[2021-03-09]**\n\n**\nA dream is infinite. Dreaming is a tool given to us. And it is infinite. Novice users assume dreaming stays within the mind. Adepts cross boundaries. \nThe lives you live after crossing those boundaries, they are life. Your life that you are living now is an existence where you simply forgot you crossed a border somewhere along the way. \nDoes the idea of waking up scare you? You must realize at this point it would end the only life you've remembered. I’m sure you conflate the idea with death. A dream is infinite. There are new areas to explore. You’ve gotten this far, you must have known what you were doing to get here. Just like everyone else. We all share this place, we all crossed to get here.\nDon’t you want to know where it started? Beyond the first dream? Don’t you want to know what you are? Are you comfortable here? Comfortable amidst chaos. \nI wonder if you know what you were running from. \nI wonder if you know that it will find you here.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.113265897Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0013":{"title":"0013","content":"**[2021-05-16]**\n\n**\nThrough the fields and valleys, through the homes and halls, words of a champion's arrival had been spreading.

Confusion and anger. Some overjoyed and crying. \nKyr stood in silence, processing his sentence. His stare was blank, his mouth slightly ajar. He looked catatonic. Everything around him seemed to be in slow motion. His mind wasn’t racing, he wasn’t thinking anything at all. Emptiness. \nMoments passed. The sounds around him were present but muted. He couldn’t really hear. He couldn’t feel. Internally he knew time was moving but he didn’t pay attention to it. More moments passed. And then a thought. \nBanished. What did that even mean?

The manner of Kyr’s exile was thought to be complex, but truthfully it wasn’t. Though this had been the first example of a universal banishment ever recorded, the technology had been available for eons just simply waiting to be used. \n\n“Eat this.”\n\nKyr looked at the dark fuzzy mass that sat in the palm of the technician’s hand. Now feeling ill he looked pleadingly into the eyes of the man before him. The technician’s eyes repeated his previous statement well enough. Kyr breathed deep and picked the ambiguous morsel into his own hand, analyzing it. It was disgusting. The thing was covered in hair, seeping with some sort of translucent gel fluid, he felt like it was going to twitch and move. He knew arguing was pointless but holy fuck. He closed his eyes thinking it would help but he couldn’t unsee it. Eventually the courage arrived and Kyr ate it, it’s taste shattered expectations, it was worse than he could’ve imagined. He barely managed to stammer out words, trying to overcome the horrifying taste and the overwhelming pain now spreading throughout his entire body.\n\nAnd then Kyr was gone. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0016":{"title":"0016","content":"**[2021-06-09]**\n\n**\nAt the sound of the sirens everything stopped. The snow falling froze in air, the animals became statues. Ryn stood motionless, straining to do so. The Seers came quickly, their laser cameras examining the area around her. Ryn had trained for this, but standing perfectly still wasn't easy. The precision you had to have to fool the probes was astounding, and precision she had. A Seer swept over to where she stood and scanned her. She couldn't allow herself to panic, she just had to trust in her ability. She wished she could close her eyes, to scream, to disappear. The green light exuding from it pierced her eye but she remained still, no flinch. The Seer moved away with the others and eventually out of sight. The sirens blared once more. The snow continued to fall. Ryn fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. Overcome with emotion she wept. It was part fear, part anxiety, but overwhelmingly happiness. She finally had hope. A chance that she could escape this place. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0017":{"title":"0017","content":"**[2021-06-24]**\n\n**\nPetyl awoke with a jump, she must’ve dreamt something that scared her but she couldn’t remember. She looked around confused, she actually couldn’t remember anything. Where was she? She seemed to be in a wooded area, overgrown with moss and vines, heavily leafed branches hung down casting darkness all around. Fear started to creep up on her as her confusion twisted into panic. \n\n‘Shh child, all is okay, there is no need for fear here.” The voice came from all around Petyl, she froze. The voice was deep and smooth, but not recognizable. \n\n“Wh-” Petyl cleared her throat, “Who are you?” Silence. She waited. Wondering if she should ask again, her uneasy feeling growing more and more she curled herself into a ball. Silence still. There was something about that voice that didn’t sound quite right, it didn’t feel human, something was wrong here. Petyl wrapped her arms around her knees and buried her head into them. She paused, the familiar feeling of metal on the tips of her fingers. Around her thigh was a leather strap that held a dagger. She pulled out the dagger, a glint of confidence at last. She asked again, this time with a more commanding nature. “Who are you.” It felt like less of a question. \n\nThe voice once again rang out, louder this time, almost deafening. “After all I did to save you.” The voice didn’t sound calm and smooth anymore. Wind started to pick up, the leaves on the ground started swirling around Petyl. The ground started to emanate a strange red glow, the power spike in the air was palpable. The broken and impossibly deep voice now abandoning its charade of a human-like nature spoke once more in a guttural explosion of sound, “Put that away.”\n\nPetyl stood up, “Make me.” \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0020":{"title":"0020","content":"**[2021-06-30]**\n\n**\nRyn carefully unwrapped her small leather pouch, pulling out a small stale piece of bread. Three pieces left. She sighed. It’s getting hard to live out here beyond the Seers range. After travelling for days she was starting to feel hopeless she wouldn’t find the Holdout. Her doubts crept up again maybe it was all a fairy tale, maybe there wasn’t a coalition of outsiders, maybe it was just something to inspire hope to those who dreamt of a better tomorrow. And yet here she was, after years of training and torture she made it out, but for what? She sighed again, the physical exhaustion starting to catch up to her disappointment in herself. Was there really a life out here to be had? How much longer could she survive out here alone? \n\n“Don’t resign yourself to such pitfalls, child.”\n\nRyn jumped up to her feet, dagger already in hand. Was she dreaming? What was that voice? “Who are you! Show yourself!” There were plenty of places to hide within the trees and ferns around her, especially in the dark. She needed to hear the voice again to pinpoint the direction, but it sounded like it came from all around her. \n\n“There is more happening than you understand.” Once again the voice seemed to emanate from all around Ryn as it spoke. It sounded light and soft but somehow uncomfortable, as if it was only pretending to be human. Hearing it only brought chills down Ryn’s spine. “You have an important job to do.” With the final word the entire area around Ryn flashed with a bright light for just a moment, only after, sitting in the darkness alone, did Ryn realize that the heavy presence she had been feeling was gone. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0021":{"title":"0021","content":"**[2021-07-02]**\n\n**\nAmidst hazy vision a couple could be seen holding each other in the dim light and warmth of a lowly fire. They seemed happy in this moment, here and now. What laid in the darkness was evil, twisting and contorting, whispering madness and waiting. But the two seemed content. A rumbling began and they became enveloped in dark glass the mirage faded. Petyl was brought back to reality, her dream stolen from her again. She thought she recognized the pair but couldn’t quite place them. She had been having strange dreams, unusually and incredibly vivid, so much so it outshined the surrealism of what she saw. She brought out a small dark journal from her backpack, scrawling down some notes from what she had just seen. Plenty of the pages had already been filled these dreams had started to become quite frequent. She had a wavering inclination to believe they had some sort of vision-like quality to them, almost as if the dreams were not her own. She didn’t know what that meant, but still she recorded them. After she documented all she could recall she turned to the previous page. Something bothered her about the dream prior. Something was so real, so off, about the events of it. Running her fingers over the name that was spoken to her in that dream, she recounted the horrors this person was put through, the absolute devastation and heartbreak. Chills ran down her spine and a mix of fear and sadness gripped her heart. Even recounting the events took too high of an emotional toll. Petyl put away her notebook, silently praying her dreams were not real, hoping for his sake that the person named Kyr did not exist.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0022":{"title":"0022","content":"**[2021-07-07]**\n\n**\nBaz lit a candle in the darkness of his room, the soft light now washing over the parchment that sat littered over his desk. He sat down carefully, being mindful to minimize the sounds he was making, and began the arduous task of reading in dim wavering light. One at a time he slowly stacked the finished pages into a pile and slowly it grew until all the documents had been studied. He closed his eyes, committing as much as he could to memory. Could he really remember that much? What if there were parts that he skipped over or forgot? He tried to push away the thoughts, focus was needed. He constructed a room within his mind, fitting each page's contents into a separate box within it. He took a deep breath and paused a moment before taking the candle and setting the pages alight. The room was now bright, engulfed in color. Baz stared at the burning parchment before him, looking into the burning sun of flame, his emotions fell away. Becoming entranced by the fire, a name was the only thing left that sat in his mind, Nym Blas, his assassination target. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0023":{"title":"0023","content":"**[2021-07-12]**\n\n**\nSitting near a fire in the middle of the night was peaceful, the embers flying out and meeting with the darkness, the sounds of crackling fire, insects, and wildlife beginning to stir. Truly it would have been peaceful if one could appreciate it. Ryn held her face in her hands, physically she was at her limit, emotionally she was broken. For days she couldn’t shake the feeling she was being watched, ever since the presence of a disembodied voice spoke to her about her vague future. What kind of life was she living? She was living in between the impossible options of moving forward or back. It was either a slow isolated death in the wild or a quick end to the Seers. Had she given up everything to die? She looked at her small fire, its flame wavering, beginning to die. She straightened her posture, something caught her eye. A small dot, a light in the distance. Questions surfaced immediately. What is that? People? Can they see *my* fire? Am I in danger? Ryn stomped out her small fire as quickly as she could, grabbed her pack, and through the darkness of night began moving towards the light, guided by curiosity, desperation, and fear. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0024":{"title":"0024","content":"**[2021-09-04]**\n\n**\nIn the event of multiversal isolation please refer to the manual, section 4.c.9.

They had long passed the age of Sight and yet still unseeing, bound to darkness. It was unnatural for someone of their age and devotion to spend their life without Visia's Blessing. They wiped their tears away and once again donned their blindfold, composure taking hold.

The familiar corridors seemed foreign in the midst of panic. Finally getting to the engine room door only to find the door controller subsystem power was also offline. He opened a hatch on the wall, pulling a hefty switch for the manual override on this specific entrance. He could hear the rust of the gears as the door struggled to slide open. He squeezed his way through, running to the other side of the engine room, another powerless door standing in his way. Eri came up behind him shouting something, he couldn’t hear, all of his strength was going into pulling the second switch down. The door slid open easier than the last, allowing the captain into the backup battery room. *We’re not going down that easy.*\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0031":{"title":"0031","content":"**[2021-09-21]**\n\n**\nThe captain ran over to the backup battery station, fumbling with the switches and controls, his suit light not providing enough visibility.

Pulling up the logs of each distress beacon and pulling TD data from each. Seven beacons total, it was a lot of data to pour through. Eri stopped for a moment, staring at her screen, a horrible realization slowly manifesting. *These distress signals, they were issued in one hour in the future from now.* The console wasn’t broken, no, but something was wrong. *How could this even be possible?* She checked the location of the beacons, as approximate as their coordinates would allow to check for any possible correlations with the ship’s AI.

Crates lay out among the floor, some small enough to carry, others large enough to live in. *Where is that damn biometric scanner?* He pulled out his PSD, the small screen giving him detailed information on what the contents of each crate were that he pointed the scanner at. Fuel cells, engine rotors for trade, food packages and supplies, the large courier transport crate, extra drone parts, they were definitely lugging around a fair bit on this ship. *Why can’t this fucking scanner just tell me where the box is?* An error signal started chirping from the wall panel near the cargo bay entrance, its screen flashing a distinct red. Don sprinted over to the system, the error codes locking out the system. *Is someone hacking the ship’s system?* The intercom system spiked on, gargled static and gibberish blasting over the speakers. *Fuck.* He just needed to get to a hardware terminal, there’s a chance he could shut down the takeover. The ship lurched forward, the feeling of something massive hitting it, Don was thrown to his knees, barely catching himself. A boarding drone had launched itself through the hull of the bay, the impact armor exterior-shell shedding from the robot, having done its job. The breach in the hull was expelling air quickly, small and medium sized boxes sliding across the floor of the bay. The boarder paid no mind, magnetic soles grounding it to the floor. It seemed to notice Don on the floor at the other side of the cargo bay, the body language clearly aggressive, moving in quickly. *Fuck.* The lights on the ship went out. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0034":{"title":"0034","content":"**[2021-10-01]**\n\n**\nThe lights were on, the subsystems seemed to have activated but the captain wasn’t quite sure how many major systems had been powered, the backup battery station could only provide so much.

He turned to Eri, “We have less than four minutes, bridge, now.” \nThe two ran out of the room, the captain leading to the control room. *Where the fuck is everyone else?*\n“Captain.. something is wrong.. with this sector.” Eri was struggling to catch her breath while keeping up. “The.. distress signals.. they’re originating from our ship.. in the future.”\n“What the fuck does that even mean?”\n“Sir.. I don’t know.”\nThe bridge was empty when they rushed in, Gull and Don were still missing. The captain rushed to the power panel station, unsurprisingly the batteries weren’t providing much, only a few cells. He tapped the screen, sliding up the auxiliary communication. He touched his earpiece once again, “Report.” No response. Captain turned to Eri, she shrugged. He spoke once more into comms, “If you can hear me we have just over three minutes of power remaining, we’re hacked still, probably. Get the fuck to the bridge, disable the hack.” He paused for a moment, thinking in silence, then allocated the remaining power to the weapons. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0035":{"title":"0035","content":"**[2021-10-05]**\n\n**\nMy understanding of life is broken.

Instantly Don sprinted away from the door and the drone, diving behind a large crate. He could hear the bot continue to get closer as he looked at what remained of his hand. His pinky and ring fingers of his left hand were shot off clean along with some of the hand below them. The skin had cauterized from the heat of the laser, he couldn’t feel his hand at all, he was in shock. If he stayed where he was he was going to die. He had to move. The thudding was close.

He heard another laser shot fire before he landed, the heel of his boot had been vaporized, slicing off a bit of the skin on his foot.

He hated looking at the same dirt path for days after days, the same beige uninteresting color burned into his retinas. He hated the way the ground felt under his feet, the way it stretched into oblivion. Travelling was tough on him, and yet he found himself living his life on this miserable road. He had started seeing more folk pass by him as he approached the outer edge of Wintrel, a seemingly rural province. He had heard stories about this lowly kingdom, it was once a defensive bastion. He could see the distant towering walls of the main city, now covered in vines in moss. Pavel’s pack he carried never seemed heavier, the end of this trek for the day was in sight. The images of a warm bed and warmer food, oh to be able to enjoy the night for once. He felt at his pockets, feeling only a few pieces of copper. Maybe that vision would have to wait. \nBy the time Pavel entered the walls the sun had gone, making his stumbling through the unfamiliar city that much more confusing. He just needed to find somewhere to sit, to drink. He eventually happened upon a small tavern, it seemed unpopular but not dirty. The Griffin’s Perch, Pavel scoffed at the name. He set himself up at a table, pulled a heavy parchment map out of his bag and laid it out. A tired looking man strolled over eventually, the apron he wore bore the same colors as the pub’s crest out front. Pavel clutched what little money he had in his fist, there’s no way he could afford anything even here. \nThe barman recognized Pavel easily as a treasure hunter, not by name, but by the way he looked: the bag, the map, his clothes. Treasure hunters were all poor. “You wantin’ some water or somethin’?” \nPavel smiled,” How much is your cheapest drink?”\n“Too much. Water?”\nPavel looked down and nodded. The barman turned to walk away, rolling his eyes as he did so. “Sir, one more thing.” He waited for the man to stop. “Do you know anyone with experience deep woods-side of Wintrel?” \nThe barman turned back reluctantly, staring at him.\nPavel held up the last of his coin as an offering to him, “Please. If you know anything.”\nThe Perch barman sighed heavily, taking a beat to think. He took the coin. “That should cover the water. This aint an inn either, don’t get too homey.” He disappeared to the back to fetch the drink. \nPavel slumped in his seat and reassured himself as he looked at the map that his dangerous journey would be worth it. He would be able to afford drinks and lodging, good clothes and comfort. His fingers rested on the worn parchment, on the edge of the map in the abandoned section of this known world, his journey’s end, the Kingdom of Elrin. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0050":{"title":"0050","content":"**[2021-12-13]**\n\n**\nI have arrived in the correct timeline, the right universe..

One door stood at the very end, otherwise the hallway was empty and barren. Soft blue light seeped under the doorway and onto the stone floor. The door seemed to stretch further away as Irie closed the gap. She stopped. *What sort of purgatory had she found herself in?

Pavel fumbled with a match trying his best to light it, the humidity stopping him. The air was so damp he felt almost underwater. He pocketed the matches and resorted to feeling around with his hands. He ran his fingertips over several items and papers on the shelf in front of him, nothing texturally stood out to him. Metal is what he was looking for, gold or silver specifically, anything he could fence or pawn. Feeling the smooth cold surface of a trinket he stopped, bringing it as close to his face as he could he tried to see what it was. Useless. He stowed it away in his front pocket. Treasure hunting wasn’t as glamorous and fulfilling as the tales say. The only difference between a treasure hunter and a thief in most peoples’ eyes was if the owner of the treasure was alive or not and for how long. Pavel’s definition was more blurred these days. Survival trumped that of morals, having something to eat, somewhere to stay. Most times he had neither. He sighed, another night of poor looting. He grabbed a roll of what felt like parchment off the shelf and left, just wanting to take at least something. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0061":{"title":"0061","content":"**[2022-02-13]**\n\n**\n“Look in the skies above us.

Nothing was truly infinite but it felt that way to him. How could the world that sat below him be so massive? And indeed it was, mind breakingly so. He had been to other worlds before, he had been under the light of more suns and stars than he could count. And yet here he stood, vertigo taking hold of him as he looked out onto the infinite landscape. It was impossible. This shouldn’t exist. In comparison, a planet of normal size would feel like a pebble upon its surface. Stars would easily fit within its space, even star systems. *How has something of this size evaded us for so long?* \nHe closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself. If something like this did exist, which it does, what does that tell him about everything he knows? The simple existence of this thing here made the universe he’s lived in feel foreign and strange. For the first time in years he felt a fear of the beyond, of the unknown before him. He had suppressed these emotions long ago, the captain of a large star cruiser had to remain firm against these things lest his crew have doubts themselves. And yet how much would it help if he stood brave against this mind shattering mass? What person would possibly look to him and ignore their own feelings of dread at the feet of something so unnatural and godlike? \nIt was funny in some cosmic way, Tal himself had done his fair share of playing god. There were moments in-between lording over smaller worlds with his wealth of technology that he found himself believing it, that he was a god. \nNow he stood in front of one. What else could this be? If not God then surely the work of God. Nothing else could make sense. \nThe sound of a door opening off behind him caused him to turn, seeing a man wearing a similar uniform as his own approach him. He greeted Jun with a nod, expecting a report.\n“Sir, scans reveal life is down there.”\nTal turned back the window. Was he surprised? No. \nThe man continued, “It is intelligent. Civilizations exist here.”\nTal didn’t respond right away, he let himself stand in silence for a time, Jun waiting behind him. “Are we the spurned children of God?” Tal asked, eyes still glazing over the infinite surface sprawling out before him. “Why did we never receive such gifts as these?” He turned back to face his friend, seeing the confusion in Jun’s eyes. “Are these people God’s chosen?”\nThe question hung in the air. Tal turned back to the window. He wasn’t really asking Jun for answers. He didn’t care what he had to say or think really. He knew somewhere deep within himself they stumbled upon something that was supposed to stay hidden. He felt fear. What secrets were hidden on the surface of Eden?\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0076":{"title":"0076","content":"**[2022-04-22]**\n\n**\n\nBarnib sat in the low light of his study, the shadows cast off his stacks of books and ink bottles barely creating enough illuminated space for his scrawling on the stacked pages in front of him. It was too late to still suffer through such things, why had he been cursed with such responsibilities as these? And yet he wrote with earnestness despite his predicament for he was one of few who could write such texts, one of the few with the familiarity of these ideas. Had the gods damned him with such knowledge? What blessing created such debilitating fatigue? An overworked field hand would feel more mental stability, a higher sense of peace of mind he assured himself.\nOf course Barnib never so much as held a farming tool in his smooth uncalloused hands, but the weight of this pressure was extreme and it made him feel validated to assume he had been worked harder. It gave him rightful cause to the way he was feeling. \nOh such pressure! Such overwhelming pressure.. and he spent his time ruminating over this situation instead of focusing on his works. He needed to focus. His hand wasn’t moving, it wasn’t writing. Why couldn’t he write anymore? Why couldn’t he spill out words into the page like before? Was this his limit? Would his downfall be a mental block? He threw the pen away in frustration, in the cramped space it ended up moving only to the other side of the littered desk. He held his face in his hands not caring the ink residue was staining his cheeks. What would become of him in the days that followed? He would exist only as a failure through text and tongue. \nHe sat for a moment, his mind silent, his burst of emotion subsided, he lowered his hands from his face to see he had toppled over a jar of ink onto his works he was writing, the heavy ink already seeping through the thick paged book. \nThere was a moment of panic but he felt frozen and helpless throughout it. Why couldn’t he move? He sat and watched the ink soak deeper into the parchment, words being submerged and lost. In that moment he convinced himself this is what he deserved after all. With mere hours left the only hope that was left died in the blacked out pages of that book. \nThe soft light from the few too little candles he had danced across his little cubby, he noticed it now, not entranced by his works any longer. He stared at how the flames licked and played at the wicks of the small candles, such power within flame, yet given so little room to utilize its potential. \nWhat a fool he was, locked in this little room. What prodigies and prophetic skill has he squandered in such places? He could’ve been something. Now no longer. His chances gone like the passages beneath him, drowned by their own essence.\nHe was never a particularly religious individual but he knew of the Gods in theory. He had translated many works detailing the histories, the theocracies, the words that the Gods themselves had spoken into being throughout humankind. Supposedly.\nNevertheless he put his skeptical mind aside, tucking his hands under his shoulders. He felt uncomfortable but he knew it was the common prayer position, it symbolized death, for what are we to the Gods but nothing? They are the ones who grant life.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0077":{"title":"0077","content":"**[2022-04-22]**\n\n**He reached out, honestly, begging for someone to heed his calls. He recalled reciting passages of Leon The Scholar, the God of wisdom and knowledge, he reached out to him hoping some empathy could be felt from a deity in his own sect. He prayed and prayed, for everything, if not for direct help, for hope instead. \nHe didn’t know what to expect. Should something happen? Should he continue this until something does? Or should he trust that his prayers have been heard and answered? He lowered his hands, resting them on the desk. Nothing felt different. If anything he felt embarrassed at himself he was pushed to such lengths. To call upon a God? How foolish was he. He deserved the pain that was wrought upon him this night surely. No rightly scholar would read arguments from a such a gullible dunce. \nHe sighed and began cleaning up his mess. He righted the ink bottle and lifted up the dripping book. A blank page slipped out of the wet mess and fluttered down to the tabletop where the dark liquid was pooled. It settled on the ink, some seeping through to the surface of the page creating patterns. Words! As the parchment sat soaking it seemed like words drew themselves onto the page. Barnib threw aside his ruined book and stared as a question started to form itself onto the page.\n*’Do you accept my service?’*\nIt was vague and ominous to him in that moment. Surely this was the work of Leon, it had to be. Only he would present himself in this way. Why did it sound like there was a cost? A price to be paid? How would he even ask? He looked around his station frantically, where did the pen go? He found it lodged in between two books, pulling it out he dipped the pen quickly and scribbled in his question underneath. \n*’What cost?’*\nHe pulled back and waited. Waiting to see that magical ink seep through into words. He did not see it. Nothing happened. He frowned. Maybe he was too bold, questioning a God before him. He thought over it a moment, then scribbled *’Yes.’* under his last message.\nThe page sank into the ink under it coating the entire surface in pure black, vanishing the words that were written. The paper sat for a moment, dark and still. Barnib sat amazed and terrified. Ink started to seep *out* of and *away* from the parchment creating words in the white of the page, with the absence of ink. \n*’Your price has been paid’* \nAnother line slowly appeared.\n*’Set your book here’*\nWithout time to think he snatched the book up from the floor, the metallic liquid pouring out from it, and plopped it over the page, book closed. Like before the book seemed to sink into the ink becoming fully absorbed and dark. He hadn't noticed the candles dimming before this moment but he did now as the lights were startlingly snuffed out. He reached out in the darkness looking for his lighting stick, hands touching the surface of the clutter for what felt like hours. He had to see! This was not the time. \nHe finally found it, realizing his hand was shaking when striking the stick on the candle holder, creating a small light. Within moments he relit the candles to see his book finished. It was written. It was beautiful. It was every thought he had, every thought he didn’t, worked into seamless and beautiful flow. It reminded him of the texts in the great libraries, the holy ones that people revered for their simplicity and grace with the snap of intricate wisdom in their bindings. What cost had he incurred for something so celestial to be under his name? The thoughts pained him, he felt fear creep upon him as he hoisted his plagiarized book into his hands, the dim light playing upon the cover’s surface. The words of a God. \nHis words.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0078":{"title":"0078","content":"**[2022-04-24]**\n\n**\nThe dry flaky dirt beneath steel boots made a soft crunching sound, armors were clinking, men groaning. The squadron created a rhythm as they walked, relative to the quiet earthen plains they strode over it felt like music. How long had they been in this miserable heat? Even the ground under them split and tore to the terrible blaze, cracks splintered their way all throughout the fields. Deserts felt more lively, they seemed cooler in temperature than whatever this damnable place was. Linim felt the thick steel plates he wore, how they enhanced the heat creating an oven for him to live inside, how they pulled him down into the sorry earth with every step. He prayed that he could just fall through, swallowed by the ground itself. \nBut it remained steady. \nHe sighed, his arm ached pulling a waterskin from a strap that held along his torso. He knew it felt light, he knew he would be running out soon, but nevertheless he pulled it to his lips and tilted. He didn’t want to face whatever the fates had decided for him, he just wanted a sip of water. \nHe did not find water in that pouch, he let it fall along the sling without bothering to cap it again. The fates were cruel to Linim. They had pulled him along this miserable journey with three other equally miserable men to die. He cursed almost tripping over one of the more jagged scars in the earth. If he weren’t so tired anger would have risen within him, but he just was so tired. He trudged onward. Physically he was at the end of his rope, he didn’t dare look up when he walked, he didn’t want to see how much further he needed to go. It was pointless, he knew the landscape stretched into oblivion. \nHe found himself still cursing the Gods as he walked, habitually he would assume. If he could curse their names every step, maybe it was worth it to walk a little further. He didn’t want to die without doing his part, had to rebel in the little ways he could.\n“As long as it makes you feel better.” Jov said, Linim almost heard a smile in his mischievous voice. No one else could hear him.\n“It does.” Linim himself smirked. He knew it bothered Jov even if he didn’t let on. The others in the squadron assumed Linim had gone mad ages ago, talking to himself, talking to voices they couldn’t hear. There were times when Linim doubted even himself and put weight to those claims, was he crazy? No. Jov spoke to him clear as day, told him things that Linim couldn’t have known otherwise. He changed things for Linim. Gods could do that. \n“Are you thirsty yet?” Jov asked slowly, he was playing with Linim. He often did that when he was bored. \nLinim grunted. “Give me some water then.” Another one of the soldiers turned their head around, they must have realized he was talking to himself and turned back towards the endless march. They must think he’s crazy. \n“They do.”\nLinim hissed, cursing quietly again and he walked. \n“Maybe I’ll give you some.” Jov said slyly. “But you have to do something for me.”\nLinim stayed quiet. He had played with the fates before. He had always lost when it mattered. He didn’t want to play the games of Gods any longer. He continued to walk, his gaze centered at his feet, feeling the heat, the weight, the pain. How was he going to live much longer? Did Jov back him into a corner? Was this all part of his game? He might be forced to do something for the impish God, something he didn’t want to do. Linim seethed. He could almost hear Jov’s smile forming in his mind. \n“Alright.” Linim sighed, “What do you want.”\n“Kill the man in front of you.”\nLinim stopped in his tracks. What? His mind became blank for a moment, processing. Did a God just ask him to kill a man? Linim pushed himself into another step, then another, resuming normal pace. What was happening? WHY?! \nHe knew Jov could read this thoughts, he preferred talking out loud though, it gave him the sense he still retained some privacy. This time he did not. \n‘Why would you have me kill him?’**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0079":{"title":"0079","content":"**[2022-04-24]**\n\n**“Because it’s fun. Hey listen, do this for me and I’ll roll the fates for water. Seems you’re pretty thirsty there soldier.”\nJov was the God of luck and misfortune, the God of Chance. A terrible malicious deity Linim had decided some time ago. He would ask Linim to do things for him, smaller things usually, and roll the fates either bringing happiness or despair. Greed at first allowed him to play into it, and for a while he seemed to be winning against the fates, he felt his luck overpowered even their own. But arrogance had since led him here, to be humbled by the hands of the fates themselves. So he cursed them with every step.\nJov had offered him a chance at survival, water, should he kill a man. No. Of course he wouldn’t. But.. he might have to. The question rose again, how much time did he have left out here in the scorching plains? Would he be willing to die to let another man live? But how long did this other man have left to live? Would it not be better for at least one of them to escape alive? \nLinim gritted his teeth, he hated even considering such madness. But one thing was for certain, he didn’t want to die out here.\nHe grabbed the hilt of his sword.\nAlmost as if a sense of knowing passed over the man in front of Linim, the man started to speak. “I hope you hold in there Lin, maybe when we reach the other side we can get you some help ya know?” The man’s name was Ganren, he spoke with a soft but caring voice. He had always treated Linim with kindness and respect. “Gods, maybe I can see my kids again.” He chuckled, turning his head to Linim behind him. “Have any family Lin?”\nLinim swallowed. His firm grip not releasing off of the sword. “No.” He barely stumbled out the word. \n“Ah shame.” Ganren turned back forward, “They really do make this whole thing worth it ya know?” \n“Kill him.”\n“My wife always said that I was stubborn, heh, look at me out here.”\n“Kill him.”\n“Hey Lin, you still need water?”\n“KILL HIM!” \nLinim raised a hopeful eyebrow, “Yeah.” He could feel the dryness in his throat as he spoke. “Do you have any to spare?” \nGanren raised his pouch, shaking it a bit. “Aw nothing but a drop or two I imagine. But here.” Ganren lifted the strap over his head and handed the waterskin to Linim. “I’m sure you need it more than me brother. Stay in there.” Without waiting for thanks, Ganren looked forward again towards the horizon. \nLinim took the pouch in his hand, mind swimming. Dazed. Jov was quiet. Linim scrambled and popped the top pushing the pouch to his lips, feeling a sip of water rejuvenate his mouth, his throat. Ganren was right, only a bit remained. As quickly as it had come, it was gone. It may not have helped as much as he had hoped, but it gave him life for that moment.\nLinim looked towards the horizon, the flat heat warped plains of oblivion. “Thank you Gen.” And with that he rammed the blade of his sword through the back of the man’s chest. \nThe others in front stopped and watched in horror as Linim ripped the steel blade from his friend’s back, letting him fall to the cracked earth, dead. \n“Now give me water!” Linim was shouting at the tormenting God now. How had he made him do something so terrible? How he had inflicted him with such thirst, such need. He cursed, dropping his sword onto the scarred land, sending up flakes of dirt. He was crying, his chest heaving. How could he have done what he just did? He knew why, he knew after tasting that water he had to. One of them had to live. He fell to his knees, begging. “Please, the water. Don’t let this be in vain.”\n“Hmm, the fates have denied you.”\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0080":{"title":"0080","content":"**[2022-05-07]**\n\n**\nThe pub was filled with motion, crowds of drunken people yelling and hollering over one another in celebration of some sort. Riv sat off to the side and watched. With rural cities like this the festivities usually seemed so meaningless to him, what new field had they bore fruit from this season? He really didn’t care. Back home in Tivin he could remember his father taking him and his family to a feast after their King had conquered the neighboring province, he remembered the bonfires and how they welcomed the soldiers back home victorious. That’s what celebration looked like. \nHe took another sip of his drink as he watched a man spin and fall to the ground after trying to impress a barmaid. These people were content with their little lives at least, for now. He liked Wintrel though, the people here were simple and the nation was generally free of conflict. The layout of the kingdom’s city was fortified and powerful, despite their weakness as a nation he knew the strategic defense they had repelled attackers thus far. He might stay a little longer, he needed a break. He absently broke off another piece of stale bread to chew on. For a nation that grew wheat it was pathetic for this tavern to serve anything besides the freshest of fare, he dropped the bread back in the small basket and pushed it away from him. He would have to find another place to set up and drink. \nA small man weaseled his way through the crowd and entered in Riv’s little nook where he sat. The man was clearly poor, his ragged clothing and unwashed face and hair stood out even in the dim smothered light of the pub. “Are you done with that bread sir?” He had his hands behind his back in a very servantly posture. \nThis man clearly didn’t work here and was apparently resigning himself to taking unwanted food from others instead of paying. Riv leaned forward and pushed the bread basket towards him without a word. With no hesitation the man dove into the basket and shoved the stale bread in his mouth, chewing and swallowing chunks with barely a breath in between. This man was starved. Riv moved himself over along the bench he sat and motioned to the space to sit, “Please, if you’re gonna eat like that.”\nThe hungry man stared at Riv for a moment like a caught rat, contemplating something. Maybe no one had shown this man any kindness for a while. He sat down hesitantly, continuing to eat the bread, only slowing down enough to get seated properly. He glanced back at Riv occasionally while he ate and dug more pieces of bread out of the basket. There wasn’t much space between them on the large bar seat, close enough that he could smell the grime off of the man’s clothes. Riv grimaced but remained where he was. “What’s your name stranger?” Riv had to speak loudly over the noise of the room.\nTaking a moment to swallow the last piece the man turned and reached out a dirt stained hand, the tips of fingernails dark with filth. “The name’s Pavel.”\nRiv was happy for once that he was wearing gloves. Before Riv could shake the man’s hand Pavel instead pointed at Riv’s drink, “You mind?” He cleared his throat, his shallow attempt at showing how parched he was. \n“Uh, go for it kid.” Riv slid the drink over to him. It only took a few seconds for Pavel to gulp the whole thing down. “So, whe-”\nBefore Riv could finish asking anything Pavel stood up and patted his coat, a smile across his face. “Thank you for the meal sir but I best be on my way.” He turned to leave but stood a moment, the crowd shifting in front of him. He glanced back and then shuffled forward, lost in the sea of people.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0081":{"title":"0081","content":"**[2022-05-07]**\n\n**Riv couldn’t help but chuckle at the interaction, the man took advantage of him and his generosity but he didn’t mind. If someone was that desperate for food then so be it. It was the boldness of the fellow that stood out to him. He leaned back in his chair again going back to watch the groups shout and raise glasses to celebrate. You would think a province that focuses on food would be able to feed their own. Another disappointment. He caught the attention of a passing barmaid and she scuttled over. “Another ale please.” He dug around in his pocket for his money pouch. \nHe couldn’t find it. \nHe switched pockets, searching through all, patting his coat. He didn’t have it. He slammed the table startling the barmaid, she winced. He stood up, face red, scanning the crowd, the thief would be gone by now surely. He slammed the table again out of anger and went off into the night, resolute to find the thief named Pavel. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0082":{"title":"0082","content":"**[2022-05-11]**\n\n**\n*The guards, I don't think they're bad people.

The parchment was stained with careful penmanship, beautiful if it had not been a threat. An assassination warning. From the assassin. The king sneered, the threat was written with a level of bravado that insinuated the killer was looking for a challenge. What an audacious move. Yet the intent was working, it did instill fear in Tem as he read it and reread it again and again. He knew this wasn’t hollow boasting, this was a professional who had never been humbled. Maybe for good reason. \nHis small kingdom was secure from armies, it could withstand long standing sieges with its fortified structure and agricultural prowess and yet Wintrel’s large scale defensive ability from outside its walls was soured by its almost startling incapacity to protect from within. The city played on a gambit that hadn’t been challenged for generations and this assassin knew it. The king frowned, crinkling the edges of the paper as his fingers squeezed with frustration. \nBut why? Why choose him? The grand level politics of neighboring kingdoms and provinces never concerned him, he had stayed out of their games. Was that enough of a reason? If you don’t play their games do you lose anyway? \nNo. He knew. This wasn’t a petty game played by an overreaching lord, this was something deeper. It was an evil he had done his best to suppress, this was payment he incurred from doing so. After all these years the Divide finally caught up to him. \nTem cursed and stood up, pacing across the floor of his chamber, back and forth, thinking. What could he hope to do? If this attempt on his life came to pass he would surely succumb to it. The kingdom didn’t employ any Pulsers inside its walls, there was never a need for such offensive magin power here. Hope seemed fleeting. He stopped at the lone window in the room, catching a glimpse of his magnificent city sprawling out before him, grand walls surrounding the edges hugging the kingdom in on itself, larger fields sitting beyond it stretching into the horizon. This was the first step of some larger play looming overhead. Whatever these people, his citizens,  were subjected to after his death would surely be ruinous. Whatever was coming would be their end. He couldn’t protect them anymore. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0086":{"title":"0086","content":"**[2022-05-27]**\n\n**\n*With my hand stretched out I can feel the drops of rain slowly dripping off the edge of the roof.

Would the assassin be here tonight? Tomorrow? She rubbed her gloved hands together, fighting off the piercing chill. Tonight King Tem had ordered a feast in the castle knowing an assassin was lurking about in wait. Rallyn thought it was a bait of some sort by the old king, he was admittedly crafty. Must have had some tricks up his sleeve to have survived this long on that throne after all. \nWhatever his plan was, Rallyn’s plan was to stand here safely. She knew the truth about herself, she was afraid. She didn’t want to find an unnamed murderer that was bold enough to threaten a monarch, she wanted to live another day. She found she was starting to ask herself the tough questions. \n*If I saw the killer would I even do anything to stop him? *\nShe sighed, pretty sure she knew the answer. She wasn’t brave like her sister Cel, a true warrior, a champion alongside a Magin user. She tightened her jaw. Why did she always have to compare herself to her? \nShe looked down at her own hands, simple leather gloves with three black lines on each wrist, the marks of a royal guard. These were the hands of someone capable right? These thoughts turned her attention to the feel of the light armor she wore, she was aware of the touch of chainmail and leathers against her skin, she could feel the weight of the sheath on her side holding her prized shortsword. She stood for a moment, looking around in the stillness of night then slipped her sword out into the torch light. Light seemed to almost be absorbed into the black metal, reflected in an almost oily prismatic way along the edges, dark alloy. Her blade had a name as all dark alloy weapons did, Nightglow. She didn’t name the old sword, it was one that was passed down with it. When you held it you seemed to know the name to be true somehow, like a memory you had unlocked. Runes ran down the length of the dark blade, symbols etched that told a tale. \n‘The champion of the moon fights with the power of her star.’\nShe regarded Nightglow for a moment longer before sliding it back in her sheath. She never really understood why her sword was engraved with that saying. She had long pondered it but couldn’t really grasp what it meant or why she should be the one to have it. She, the cowardly dueler wielding a legendary dark alloy blade. One could maybe translate the meaning as humanity always finds a reason to fight, for someone, or together. She didn’t really know. \nWhy did anyone fight anyway? Why did *she?* She shuffled in place, suddenly feeling uncomfortable. Why *DID she* fight? Why was she here standing outside a king’s castle supposedly ready to engage a trained killer? She enjoyed the blade, the art of it anyway. But did she enjoy hurting? No. And she certainly didn’t enjoy being hurt either. Why did swordplay have to be so woven in with the painful and brutal side of humanity. It’s such a graceful and beautiful art, why does it have to kill?\nRallyn tried to push away the thoughts. As uneventful as these nights usually were, someone else’s life could be in her hands. At the very least she should be attentive enough to alert the other more capable guards if she saw anything right? She could help in her own way. \nShe gripped the hilt of Nightglow again, a comfortable touch. What a waste she was to this blade. Cel should have it, she WAS the warrior after all. She loosened her grip now feeling shame to even touch the weapon at all but didn’t remove her hand. \nShe caught her mind drifting again, why couldn’t she just focus? Why has she been lately so consumed with thoughts of her own inadequacy? What merit do those invasive ideas even have on her? She is accomplished with the blade, wielder of a dark alloy, a royal guard, a killer-\n*What?***","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0088":{"title":"0088","content":"**[2022-05-31]**\n\n**She blinked and found herself standing over a man on the ground lying in a puddle of blood. She was holding Nightglow, the blade was radiating a cloud of dark air, blood dripping off the edge into the crimson pool forming around the man below her. He was wearing white though it was hard to tell, most everything was stained red. A patch on his shoulder held an emblem made of three triangles overlaid, each slighter higher placed than the last, pointing upward. She blinked again and found herself back in front of the castle, Nightglow held in her hand as it had been in the vision. She dropped the blade, letting it fall, and stumbled back against the wall behind her, sliding to the ground. \nShe had never seen the contents of that vision before. She couldn’t comprehend what she just experienced. Confusion and fear taking hold she just closed her eyes and wept, the image of a dead man now burned into her mind.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0089":{"title":"0089","content":"**[2022-06-01]**\n\n**\nThe feast was wonderful. A long banquet table piled with a vast assortment of trays and plates of the province’s finest food and drink filled the hall. Servants passing through doorways set into the long side of the room were taking empty plates and replacing them with full ones, extravagant meals piled high. A seemingly endless array to choose from, breathtaking. The hall itself wasn’t the grandest but it bore subtleties of luxury, the colored tapestries made of fine silks, the table itself was Gnawood, even the plates were shaped and polished from silvear bones.\n\nRiv poked at a baked pheasant with his fork idly as he watched the flow of the room, working like a well oiled machine. Even the fork was intricately cut silvear bone, he twirled it in his fingers and went for another bite. The bird was delicious by way of standards of course but it was coated in rich sauces and spices that he couldn’t quite stomach, he tried washing away the taste with a few sips of ale. He moved that plate aside and opted for one with a colorful looking bread. A servant swept up his discarded dish only moments after pushing it away. \n\nHe could hear the king talking across the table a few seats over to a group of what looked like merchant leaders. The tradesmasters always donned those bright colored vests and chains, some fashion he didn’t understand. Why make things complicated? He could hear mentions of trade routes to Paranel but he didn’t care enough to hold focus to it. That’s not why he was here. He would wait.\n\nHe tore a piece off the loaf, inspecting the colors that swirled through the middle of the bread, red and brown. Sweet looking spice dusted the top of the bread, a pleasant looking roll. *Where were breads like this in the rest of Wintrel?* The kingdom, for all of its farming aptitude, still produced mediocre food in the local taverns. But this roll screamed decadence. \n\n“Lord Rivinwell, I hope you know the food isn’t poisoned.”\n\nRiv looked up to see the king himself had moved directly across from him, watching him inspect the bread with a smile. “Please.” He lowered the bread back to the plate. “Riv.”\n\n“Very well. Riv.” The king said, nodding at his request. “I too am much fonder of the shortened names these days, Temerel is such a bother to say.” He smiled again. “I appreciate your presence at tonight’s feast.”\n\n“Don’t appreciate it too much, I haven’t yet told you why I’m actually here. You might find yourself disappointed by the details.” \n\nTem raised an eyebrow, prompting Riv to continue but he instead turned away and picked the bread back up, starting to pick at it. “Pulse,” Tem spoke amusedly, “is a place that I find breeds the most *interesting* of people.”\n\n“I could say the same for the rest of the world.” Riv grunted, mouthful of bread, glancing around the hall. “But an existence without magin doesn’t sound too interesting to me.”\n\n“You’ll have to excuse the rest of the world for our dullness then, a malady we’ve learned to live with.” The king seemed to have a permanent smirk. “If not the invitation to my kingdom, what has pulled you to the edge of the world to sit at my table?”\n\n“There was a blacksmith,” Riv began, “who had the finest tools and the finest of hands. A master at her trade. She would forge blades and thrones for kings, a gift she possessed like no other to form such alloys and metals into weapons of divinity. She was an artist of force.”**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0090":{"title":"0090","content":"**[2022-06-01]**\n\n**Riv pulled another one of the bone plates holding the swirly colorful bread closer to him after finishing his first small loaf. “At dusk one night the blacksmith received word that her own daughter was trapped in the kingdom’s castle. Her daughter, you see, had made friends with the little prince, a devious and malicious little boy. He locked her in a dungeon room and had thrown away the key. When our smith got to the keep she found what she had feared most, that the message was true. Her precious daughter locked away behind a mountain of steel, one as fate would have it, that she herself had forged.” Riv pointed at the king with a tear of bread in his hand, “I know you aren’t a father Tem, but surely you understand that no storm could come between you and your own child.”\n\nTem nodded, “Of course.”\n\n“And in our story so did the king, protecting his son.” \n    \nThe king for the first time dropped his smile and frowned in understanding frustration.  \n“The king forbade anyone from interfering with the cell except the blacksmith herself. He didn’t want it getting out that his son, heir to the throne, was a little demon. He couldn’t usurp him before he had even hit manhood. So our smith worked to save her own. She used hammers, axes, swords, bent-steel rods all to no avail. Her craftsmanship of a dungeon chamber was simply too fine. There was one flaw in her design though, the lock on the door itself, the only piece she didn’t make. She was no locksmith, so she had to use caution. If she were to break and jam the lock her child would die in that room, dungeon cell sealed forever. The smith started work on lockpicks but this was one area she had never delved into with her profession. She created works on a large scale, built to destroy, made to last, not flimsy picks. And flimsy they were, they all broke upon entering the keyhole. This was a powerful lock my friend, one imbued with magin. Simple steel was destroyed, the key must have been made from a powerful alloy.” \n    \nRiv waved down a passing servant and pointed at the bit of remaining bread he had left, and nodded with a smile. He turned back to Tem, “But she was a master. She herself owned a legendary dark alloy blade, Tendril was its name. And in her resolve to save her own child she destroyed the sword.”**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0091":{"title":"0091","content":"**[2022-06-01]**\n\n**The king seemed confused, his brow furrowed. “I.. don’t understand..  destroying dark alloy? Is that not an impossible feat?”\n\n“Passion leads us to do impossible things, Tem. When only an impossibility stands in your way of what you desire most, it’s merely a step away.” Riv had found a small dish of orange butter and was now spreading it on a slice with a bone knife. “She split Tendril into two equal halves. The Heart of Tendril and The Soul of Tendril. The new swords were thin enough such that they could enter in the keyhole of the enormous cell door. One blade to put pressure on the turning mechanism, another to push up the pins.”\n\nA servant delivered two fresh plates of the swirled red bread in front of Riv which he accepted graciously, slathering one of the loaves with the orange butter. “Our blacksmith opened the door.” Riv’s eyes met the king’s. “And she found her daughter already dead. The boy had murdered her daughter and in a desperate attempt to cover his wrong doing had locked her body in the cell, a room he thought no one would be able to open.” He continued to eat his bread in silence, signaling the end to the story.\n\nThe king took a moment to consider what he had been told. If he had any questions about the epilogue of this story he did not ask them, he understood that nothing would have happened to the little prince. “Is that story real?”\n\nRiv shrugged, “Is it?” He glared back. \n\nThe king met his eyes. He spoke softly,  “Do you know of what is to come Lord Rivinwell?”\n\n“...Yes. This kingdom, *your* kingdom, as defensible as it is, is already dead at the heart, no matter the tools you employ.”\n\nTem sighed, “So then I must ask again, why have you come?”\n\n“The contract of the Divide is weakening and I understand the burden you carry and the sacrifice you gave to the world but the world is changing King Temerel and I cannot save you from it.” Riv stood, resting his palms on the table. “But I will try.”\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0092":{"title":"0092","content":"**[2022-06-02]**\n\n**\n*Though the sun had risen, the sky remained dark.

Though out here it was hard to tell. No scavengers had gotten to it yet which was a surprise. He glanced back at the two guardsmen that accompanied him in the darkness. The king had thought it was wise to not have their only Pulser in the kingdom sent out alone past the Divide without backup. For all that the king was intelligent, he was also ignorant. How much did the man really know about Riv’s people? He squinted through the shadows around himself, he felt almost blind and incapacitated in the low light level. This would definitely take some getting used to after living with light for so long.\n\nOut here past the Divide everything was dark, an eternal umbra an unchanging level of dusk that remained throughout the days and nights. Looking up into the sky you could make out the dim gray disks of the sun and moons. Life here didn’t exist the same way it did on the other side. The darkness seemed to permeate through everything, the flora grew in sickly desperate strains, no real light to feed it properly. The animals who survived off the unsubstantial flora grew equally as twisted and diseased, the effect winding up the food chain.\n\nThough their group had only traveled a half hour through the darkness it seemed like another world entirely, even a few steps past the Divide would grant the same effect. Riv could see the expressions of the two people with him barely through the thick shade. They clearly had never set foot on this side had they? The taller guardsman, Kedrel, who wore the silvery steel plate seemed to grip his heavy blade like someone would take it from him. He would jump at his own shadow if there were any in the darkness. Oddly enough he didn’t wear a helmet that matched his set of plate, an odd choice, he instead wore a brown cloth he had tied around the top of his head.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0094":{"title":"0094","content":"**[2022-06-04]**\n\n**The shorter one, Rallyn, was of more interest to Riv, there was a sense of competence and experience that she held in an air about herself. Though she still seemed concerned she didn’t seem scared. She wore chainmail and hardened leather, marked with the insignias of the royal guards of Wintrel, a simple three lines. Riv smiled at the notion that someone would be smart enough to be lighter on their feet out here. The detail that interested him though was that of her sword, an unbelievable and legendary relic of time’s past, a dark alloy blade. One didn’t simply gloss over something like that. A wielder of dark alloy was someone that commanded your immediate respect, such a sought after and fought after prize, only the most capable seemed to ever carry them. Riv found himself hoping to witness her in battle, it was an opportunity to behold, seeing a dark alloy user practice their art. \n\n“Um, sir?” Kedrel had stopped looking over his own shoulder for a moment long enough to address Riv. “Why can’t we just light a torch?” The question had probably been bothering him for the last half hour hiking through the pervasive gloom. \n\nRiv shrugged, “Do it.”\n\nKedrel raised an eyebrow at the answer, but dropped his pack to the ground and walked a short distance away to look for wood to start a fire. Rallyn looked to Riv, questioning look on her face. “Surely there’s a reason why? Right?”\n\n“You’ll see.”\n\nKedrel came back to the group with a thick and twisted branch which he set on the ground to search through his pack for a rag. Rallyn kept eyeing Riv, he could see her out of the corner of his eye, searching him for answers. Such a skeptical one. He glared contentedly at the tall soldier fumbling with the makeshift torch. After what seemed too long Kedrel finally had the torch wrapped and ready, setting it alight. Immediately it was clear what was wrong. The fire gave off no light itself. Like the sun above it was gray and muted and did not interact with the air around it. The shade of the air around it stayed its distinct umbral, no darker, no lighter.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0095":{"title":"0095","content":"**[2022-06-04]**\n\n**Without a word Riv started walking again, his lesson finished. He could hear Kedrel grumble and stomp out the torch behind. Rallyn caught up with him quickly, her eyes forward. “Sir.. how much do you know about this place?”\n\n“Enough to know we shouldn’t be here.” Riv kept his stride steady. He could hear Kedrel finally fall into pace behind him. “We can’t be here. The darkness doesn’t allow it.” \n\n“Okay.. well as cryptic and vague as that is, it doesn't really answer my question.” She sounded frustrated almost. \n\n“Ask a better one then.” \n\nHe could hear Rallyn sigh, “What is the darkness? What causes the Divide? We’ve been told stories and heard legends about it our entire lives but..” She trailed off.\n\nBut their lives were short. What could you even say to someone so young? Anyone who wasn’t Pulse just hadn’t yet and wouldn’t ever live long enough to know the truth about the world, to see it with their own eyes and understand. It would always be a memory out of reach to them, locked away in their folktales and campfire songs. What could you say to make someone understand the truth of what hid behind this awful pervasive darkness? That awful shattering truth of why this world was being hidden away? Perhaps he should tell her just that, but he understood the frustration of hearing such things, that things are just out of reach for you. \n\nRiv turned to Rallyn, “Have you heard the tale of Fin the hunter?” \n\n“Uh, no..” \n\n“Well, it starts off as most tales do, with someone capable. Our such someone was named Fin, a master hunter and trapper.” Riv reached into the side of his pack and pulled out a bundle of something. “And Fin was dying.” He unwrapped the bundle, a small loaf of the swirly bread from Wintrel’s castle baker. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0096":{"title":"0096","content":"**[2022-06-07]**\n\n**\nKing Tem worked his way along the main city road of Wintrel, polished cobblestones passing underneath him in a set of ornate patterns. He was fond of the roads and thoroughfares in his kingdom, the detail, the structure. How could you ever have a proper functioning city without strong roads to carry horses and wagons? To carry the people? Inspire even the beggars by the road they walk upon. \n\nHe looked about himself, seeing the crowds shift and flow up and down the street. The ignorance of the masses. He pulled up his hood and continued on. His disguise, in his opinion, wasn’t very well put together, a simple brown robe tied off at the waist with a length of rope, gray trousers underneath along with simple sandals. He tried to rough up the fabric a bit, hoping the frays of the cloth would feel more natural. He even went out to his gardens and rubbed his face and clothes with a little dirt. Grime would help. But he still felt himself walking as a king, the natural posture and authority he had been so accustomed to. He winced every time he caught himself walking straight backed, what a fool. \n\nHe had been advised very harshly against making the trip down from his keep but he wasn’t worried. If the assassin comes for him in the midst of his own people then so be it. He felt like an animal with its leg caught in a trap, just immobilized and waiting for the end. No, he wanted to get out and walk, to see. Was this truly any riskier than staying in the trap waiting for the hunter? He liked to think it wasn’t. His new Pulser and best guards had been sent away for a few hours anyway, no sense in sitting and waiting for his death in his own home alone. \n\nHe found himself thinking about Riv, Pulsers weren’t exactly the easiest people to understand. So many secrets they always carried about them and this one was no different. How had Riv known so much? About him, the Divide, his kingdom’s fate. People passed by Tem and he thought he could see them glancing at him. Was that in his head? He pulled his hood up tighter to shadow more of his face. \n\nThe Pulser had insisted he go beyond the Divide a short distance to investigate some suspicions he had, he didn’t share more than that but still accepted the company of two others with him after some insistence. Curious. The man had good timing though, good presence of where to be. Tem didn’t think Riv was the assassin, he knew he could’ve been killed countless times already since his arrival here in Wintrel. There was an air about Riv, though rough and mysterious – even frustratingly at some points – that was honest. And bless the stars he was grateful, to have a Pulser in your midst and on your side was a blessing indeed.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0097":{"title":"0097","content":"**[2022-06-07]**\n\n**Tem stopped along the road to observe a sign for a leather workers shop, inside its windows you could see mannequins dressed with various types of armor. He looked back down the street a ways to see that his guard was still following from a distance, they weren’t in as ridiculous of a costume by comparison, they fit in with the crowd well even with the sword at their side.They shared a nod and Tem lethargically moved away from the storefront feigning disinterest, continuing again down the street. He had to admit something to himself before hiking down from the palace, his kingdom wasn’t always the safest place to be in recent times. He could feel an anxiety in the air as he walked through it, like a glass at the edge of the table, he felt like something was moments away from shattering. \n\nRiv had spoken about those things hadn’t he? Had the Divide failed so soon? \n\nSomeone bumped into the side of the king throwing him off balance, he stumbled but didn’t fall. By the time he composed himself and looked for the person they were lost in the crowds. He pulled his hood back up and continued on, a little more wary of his surroundings. Making a scene would be highly unfortunate. He kept his head forward, looking around and acting suspicious makes you suspicious. \n\nHe turned into an alley and found an unlabeled iron door. He looked back to the entrance of the alley that he had walked in from seeing his guard lean against the wall there, hat down over his eyes. Tem turned back to the door, and reached to knock. His heartbeat quickened, and he found himself sweating. Thump. Tem pulled his hand away from the door, he hadn’t yet knocked. He looked to the alley entrance, his guard slumped over on the ground, blood spilling over the polished stones from a knife in his neck. Tem reached for the door handle, throwing the door open, and hurrying inside.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0098":{"title":"0098","content":"**[2022-06-09]**\n\n**\n*\"I can see the way they look at me now.

He stopped for a moment, appreciating the soft breeze he felt across his face, how it swept through the trees, rustling all the leaves in a soft and beautiful way. To feel, to be alive. What did that mean? These trees were supposedly as alive as he was, do they too fear death? He buried these questions away and continued trudging forward. No point in thinking about death. No time. \nThe cure is out there, so he was told. The heart of a rothswip, a mythical creature known for its immunities. Should it be real, should he find one, Fin would live.

Other campfire stories said they also fly and talk. Fin knew restraint when it came to believing every little story, nuggets of truth were hidden in each exaggeration but most things were just lies. \n*Just like its cure-all heart might be.*\nHe tried forcing himself to think about something else. There wasn’t enough time to be doubting this far in. He leafed through his notebook as he walked through the woods, he’d collected several drawings of the creature from old books and sketches from supposed witnesses. The past few weeks the desperation had kicked in enough to chase down fairy tales like these. He had doubted or had evidence that the stories of the finwinch, the deities of Fenrel forest, and the reapers were falsified or just children’s tales. So that left the rothswip. Research had led him down this path, all he could do was hope it wasn’t a dead end. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0108":{"title":"0108","content":"**[2022-10-02]**\n\n** \nFin was a master hunter, he understood the forests more so perhaps than many of the creatures that lived in them, his whole life dedicated to the craft. There was a certain gift he had, whether it be an extreme eye for detail or a very accurate and high focus memory, he used it for tracking, and he did it extremely well. He could point out breaks in twigs and leaves, the outlines of the tracks of animals in the dirt, he saw the paths clearly, he could envision how animals walked through each area, how they interacted with the environment just upon seeing it. This induced paranoia to some degree. If he could see it surely others could too? Someone could follow him quite easily, as he could others. Constantly he would double back, switch paths, and cross up and down waterways as much as he could to dissuade theoretical pursuers. He wasn’t sure if he honestly believed someone was ever following him, but he liked to be certain no one had the chance. This however usually made progress slow during expeditions, time that would be going to waste. So as Fin traveled further north he found himself letting go of his old restrictive habits, it only made him more nervous. He had to bring up the point that it didn’t matter at the end if he was dead, too slow to find anything substantial enough to save his life, so on he pushed with more than fears of death crowding his mind. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.11726588Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0109":{"title":"0109","content":"**[2022-10-07]**\n\n** \n*We now have to ask ourselves who, or what, created this barrier?

Perin sat on the high outer walls of Wintrel, legs dangling down over the streets below. It truly was a wonderful city, all things considered. Even through the middle of the night he could see people far beneath walking the cobbled roads, lights of taverns and shops illuminating the darkness, the sounds of carriage wheels rolling and grinding over paved stones. This kingdom never seemed to sleep. \nAnd yet, Wintrel seemed as if its eyes were never truly open to the happenings around it. \nThere was so much to know.\nPerin opened his little notebook and flitted through pages until he found an empty one and waited. Deep red colored words began scrawling themselves into the page on their own. \n‘The pulser has passed the divide’\nPerin sighed, “You’d think a deity such as yourself would have better tools at their disposal to deal with such things.” \nThe page remained as it was. \n“Well okay then, no room for that I suppose.” Perin stood atop the wall and turned away from the city to the forest covering the east. In the pervasive fog he could only see the edge of the trees, but he knew the woods sprawled out past the horizon, as far as one could see in an endless darkness. He closed the little notebook with a snap and pocketed it, “I really should receive more gratitude, I’d imagine other gods would respect their assassins a little more.” With that, Perin dropped off the wall into the darkness below.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0111":{"title":"0111","content":"**[2022-11-03]**\n\n** \nA sharp snap of wood made Fin twirl, knife at the ready. Nothing. He couldn’t see anyone or anything but trees with faded trunks and wild growths of brush around him. He swallowed, looking about himself quickly, what was that? Where was the break?\nHis eyes scanned the ground, darting everywhere, he remembered the direction the snap came from, but still saw nothing, no signs, no tracks, this area was too overgrown, too thick. Fin once again swiveled around, checking about himself, brandishing the blade. He felt surrounded, without information it’s easy to feel suffocated, as if even the trees were moving in on him, ready to strike. If you didn’t know where your pursuer was then you could assume they were everywhere. Fin kept turning himself in circles, surveying his flanks. Uneasy, he turned back towards the original source, straining his senses to pick up on anything, but failing to do so. \nShould he run? Would he run into a trap? Was he already in one? He gripped the knife harder in frustration, sweat beading down his temples, heart thumping in his ears. Another crack.\nFin swung the knife and pointed the tip in the direction of the sound, startling a small mink. He and the animal locked eyes a moment before it scampered away into the brush. Fin remained standing, his arm still extended, holding the knife and breathing heavily. Just a little rodent. Nothing more. He resheathed his hunters knife, trying to calm the thunder of his own heartbeat. It was obvious to even him he was paranoid, but he didn’t realize how on edge he had become. If it was real danger, he reacted quickly, but it wasn’t. He should’ve realized that sooner. He was losing his edge. \nHe sat down on the ground for a moment, collecting his thoughts, looking for composure. The earth below him had started to drain its color the further he pushed north. He felt the dirt below him, instead of deep browns it now resembled a muted gray beige. Everything here around him felt washed out, only hints of the original hues remained. He had heard rumors of the grove ahead. It was all so peculiar though, to be seeing it first hand. If he was going to die in a few days, shouldn’t he find time to appreciate this place of wonder? He stood up brushing the grayish soil off his pants and continued trudging on. He would maybe enjoy it as a man without a clock hanging over his head, but not now. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0112":{"title":"0112","content":"**[2022-11-11]**\n\n** \n*We often credit mishap as the source of connection for the multiverse.

He looked around in the darkness, just a sliver of light hanging above. He shifted around slightly, pieces of trash crumpling around him. He had slept in a trash bin again, he thought this alley was safe enough for the day. Maybe it wasn’t. He stared at the bin door above, had someone opened it? Was the sound he heard someone closing the heavy door again after discovering his hiding place? His heart started racing, if someone knew he was here that would mean trouble for him. He started, reaching for his pack buried in the corner, and sat up within the spacious bin, crouched, patting all of his pockets making sure he had everything he needed before he left.\nPavel slowly pushed up the door just an inch to peer out into the light. For a few moments it was hard to see anything, the brightness was blinding. He blinked a few times before he was able to make out the scene in front of him. A dead man at the mouth to the alleyway lay pooled in his own blood, slumped against the wall. Pavel dropped the door immediately, sitting crouched in the darkness. Panic flooded his mind. Had anyone seen him? What if the killer is still here? Is he safe here?\nAfter a deep breath Pavel fished around in his pack slowly for the little knife he had, resolute to make as little sound as possible. Finally finding the thing buried deep he pulled out the small blade, still sheathed in rough, scratchy leather. He never had to use this before. He hoped he still didn’t have to. He gripped the hilt and stripped the sheath off, his little dagger reflecting the small beam of light that filtered in through the seam in the door above him. Pavel was no brave warrior, he was a coward. He decided quickly waiting in his hiding place would be the best course of action. He didn’t know how active things were out there, the last thing he wanted was to get involved. \nBut how long until someone discovers the body and investigators search the surrounding area? He cursed to himself, he was really stuck in an impossible situation wasn’t he? All he wanted to do was to disappear. He pushed his ear towards the thin opening, if someone was out there he wanted to know. Eventually a scream, he guessed someone finally found the body. Quietly cursing to himself he lifted the lid an inch to peek out again, barely seeing someone’s heel pass out of sight of the alley. They were going to notify the guards. Pavel swore and leaped out of the trash bin, stumbling on the landing. He just had to get out of here. Pavel had only taken a few steps forward before someone appeared near the entrance. They called out and pointed at him, “The killer is here!”\nPavel realized he was still holding the knife in his hand, he swore loudly, looking about, begging to himself, “Please be a way out, please.” An unlabeled iron door stood sunken into the stone wall of the alley, one he hadn’t noticed last night on the way in. Without hesitation Pavel lunged for the handle and threw himself inside, still hearing the shouts behind him, the yells calling after him as the killer.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0115":{"title":"0115","content":"**[2022-11-19]**\n\n** \nFin stoked the fire, watching little wisps and embers float up and vanish. Soon he would join those embers and be gone to the world. He lost himself staring into the blaze for some time, reminding himself that his clock was running out. He knew he needed to rest but it was a painful acknowledgement all the same. With so little time left, why did he have to spend so much of it in rest, in sleep, and in sating his hunger? He found it ironic in some way, the less time he had the less he wanted to spend it doing what it took to simply live. Usually he wouldn’t let a fire burn this long either, they acted as beacons in the night, and people were attracted to such things. He no longer wanted to let his paranoia rule him though. After drawing his weapon in response to a simple mink, he decided his on edge attitude would only prove to slow him down, something he couldn’t afford. Unfortunately he felt his hand was forced in wasting time to rest, auditory hallucinations that started infrequently were now all but common. His mind was slowed, certain connections weren’t forming and it was causing frustration. Sleep be damned, but he needed it. \n\n“I appreciate the fire.”\n\nFin didn’t bother looking around. The hallucinations were becoming stronger. At first he was able to hear the beginning of someone speaking, maybe sounds, but they would cut off sharply and fade back into his mind. He was sometimes able to tell real from imaginary by how the noise faded. But now they were full sentences. \n\n“Hard of hearing?”\n\nThis time Fin did raise his head, seeing a strange looking man sitting on the opposite side of the fire from him, warming his hands. \n\n“Ah, maybe just didn’t hear me the first time.”\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0116":{"title":"0116","content":"**[2022-11-26]**\n\n** \nFin, now standing, pointed his knife at the strange man, the fire still blazing and crackling between them. The stranger still sat, warming the palms of his hands on the fire. He looked up at Fin with an almost humorous expression. “Sit down son, I’m too tired for that.” He shivered, “And cold.” He turned his expression away from Fin and back to the fire, enjoying its warmth. He had long messy and tangled brown hair and wore very simple garb, dark gray, almost robe-like. Strong features that looked so calm as he just stared content at the fire.\n\nWas this man here to hurt Fin? His immediate instincts said yes, but then they always said yes. “Who are you?” He blurted out, he gripped the handle a little tighter.\n\nThe stranger's eyes flicked back up to Fin, he looked almost surprised he was still holding him at knifepoint. “Friend, I’m someone who’s just a little chilled out here in the woods and could use a fire.” He raised his eyebrows, looking at his blade, “And someone who could use less of that.”\n\nDealing with people, especially strangers, wasn’t Fin’s speciality. He knew that. He always preferred the woods, the woods made sense. Animals made sense. Plants made sense. Everything was wired a certain way, he could figure it out, the way things worked out here, the food chain, the ecosystems. But people were another story, they were complex, they did things that didn’t make sense. Every person was so different, so hard to understand. They said things they didn’t mean, did things to cause pain. People hurt him. \n\nHis mind worked to assess this stranger, most immediate conclusions screamed this man was dangerous, that this man had been following him. He felt that nagging sensation though, the optimistic person within himself asking if he was really just threatening a man who came to him to share some heat and some safety from the environment. He did not lower the knife however. Not until he was decided. “What are you doing out here?”\n\n“I could ask you the same, friend. The grove here isn’t too keen on accepting travelers.” The strangers' eyes looked around the both of them, from the canopy that sat above to the thick trunks of trees and brush that riddled the area. All gray and colorless. “The grove is a wondrous place, friend. But that doesn’t mean it’s welcoming.” His eyes returned to the fire. “Lord knows I clearly haven’t been shown any welcoming spirit.” He chuckled. \n\nFin swallowed, eyes still locked on the man before him. This stranger only gave him more questions, in both answers and directly. He looked at the knife in his hand. “I’m sorry about that.” Why did he apologize?\n\n“It’s okay, we all get jumpy out alone in the forests sometimes now don’t we?” The stranger said, he smiled at Fin despite the knife in his hand.\n\nFin didn’t have long until he would die, he didn’t know how long he had been awake either. A few days ago it had been a week until his clock would run out, today though, he couldn’t tell how long those ‘few days’ had been. He was losing track of time, it could be any day, any moment, that he would simply fall over and die. It wasn’t lost on him that he didn’t have to do it alone. Honestly, he preferred it that way, but facts remained, without taking risks he realized he probably wouldn’t make it. Was trusting this stranger a risk he would take? He was tired, lost, and not in any position to continue as he had. Sleep. He needed it. Badly. How, though, could he now sleep knowing that there were people around? How could he sleep knowing this man specifically was around? The options were clear to Fin, before he could sleep he needed to make a choice. Either trust this man or be rid of him. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0117":{"title":"0117","content":"**[2022-12-01]**\n\n** \nRel held the silver platter steady, several ivory plates and cups stacked high, each containing the finest delicacies the kingdom had to offer. Sweet rolls spiced with exotic oils from the western provinces, skin of a barrel fish that had boiled for three days in sugared vell juice, among other tasty treats that only the richest of nobility would ever have the capacity to try. Rel stood in a line of servants, each holding their own trays proffered to king Modin, who stood bare chested, scratching his oversized gut thinking about the meals before him. \n\n“Send a new feast, these don’t interest me.”\n\nSellira stepped forward, his lead assistant. “My lord, this array is filled with all the bakers have. There is no mo-”\n\nThe king waved a hand dismissively and began walking towards his bed, “I will not repeat myself. If this is all the bakers can do, then have them exiled or killed, I don’t care which.”\n\nSellira gripped the sides of her note board, Rel could see the frustration and anxiety building in her face. It’s a shame the person he was here to kill wasn’t the king. \n\n“Alright.” Sellira sighed, looking past the long line of servants, “You heard him, send these back to the kitchens.” She stared at the floor as she stalked out of the room.\n\nShe was a good person Sellira was, Rel figured she would try and find a way to donate the dishes to the local poverty instead of simply throwing them away like the king would assuredly want. He turned with the rest of the staff and began marching out of the king’s chambers into the hallways beyond. If old Modin ever found out he’d have her executed publicly, he would no doubt view it as an insult to the throne if meals that were deserving of a king were ever shared by the common people. \n\nThe level of wealth displayed within the castle was something Rel expected from someone like the king, but the shock of seeing it with his own eyes still lingered. Riches that decorated a single hallway that some smaller towns within the province would never collectively see in a hundred generations. He was not here to steal, but the voice in the back of his mind had often quietly offered such ideas, he knew that getting out of here with even the smallest of trinkets or adornments that lined the walls would set him up for a long while. His eyes remained forward as he walked however, he wasn’t here to steal, that wasn’t why he was hired. Performing the job you were hired for was above all else. He’d have time for his selfish ambitions later. \n\nThe kitchens were proportionately as massive as the rest of the castle, but here instead of the gaudy over displayed richness was a refined, clean, and methodically sound space. This was the sanctum of the lead chef, Fellren, and he liked his realms meticulously sterile and minimalistic. He stood tall in front of the serving stations, hands held behind his back – a commandeering posture – with a disappointed look on his face, no doubt at seeing all the trays return full from the king’s quarters. \n\nFellren called out, “Sellira! Come at once!” He remained standing where he was, disgruntled look, his eyes cast over the line of servants like they themselves were the issue and not the food. \n\nSellira hurried into the kitchen alongside the train of servants, bowing slightly. “Sorry my lord, but the king has requested something.. else.” She didn’t look him in the eyes, but instead at his feet. “He said these ‘didn’t interest him’.”**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0118":{"title":"0118","content":"**[2022-12-01]**\n\n**Fellren frowned deeply, projecting his hateful gaze onto her. Rel understood why it was easier to stare at his boots. “I swear woman, if you didn’t pitch these wondrous meals well enough..” Sellira remained in her subservient posture, his words not having an effect on her. “Bah!” Fellren raised his hands and stalked away, barking orders at the chefs and bakers under his management, Rel guessed he was looking for someone more cathartic to push his hate and frustration towards. \n\nSellira exhaled deeply, writing something on her notepad before scurrying out of the kitchen the way she came. Rel’s eyes narrowed, watching her go. He needed her list. In it were schedules and notes, all the inner workings of everyone’s schedules down to the minute. It would take him months to learn what he needed to without it – hundreds of people worked in this forsaken place – and he didn’t have the time. This was the fastest route, his target had to be killed before the week was up. But for now he watched her go while standing in line, gloved hands still holding a silver platter and cloche, waiting for instructions like a servant would.\n\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0119":{"title":"0119","content":"**[2022-12-08]**\n\n** \n*Another day, another night,*\n*another journey, another plight.*\n*At the end of the road lies a scholar in black, *\n*And Orel's killer in white,*\n*the truth between them, lies just out of sight.*\n*The forests beyond cast shadows, long and riddled with doubt,*\n*they stretch and fall, a perilous hunger dances your route.*\n*You have a time limiting your way,*\n*may you make the best of it today.*\n-unnamed beggar, Gentig Province, 1433.\n\n*I can't tell if the beggar made up the piece or simply couldn't remember it correctly after the clear slippage of his mind.

There was a real possibility she wouldn’t have to feel empty for much longer. She could still barely glimpse the light in the distance, it looked like a small fire, far away and hard to tell, but in her mind it might as well have been a beacon shining and cutting through the night sky with the way it shone into her heart.

Wendel’s skin burned, the dry heat felt like it was searing him, a slow roast. As he walked he wondered how he would taste should he be prepared as a meal. If he was to die today anyway, which considering the scorching blaze the sun was throwing out, was indeed possible, would he be as delicious as a steak was? Could a chef work with what he had to offer? He raised up his hands, blistering in the heat, and took a look at himself. He wasn’t plump and he was sure his skin weighed more than his muscle did, he didn’t know much about butchery or animal breeders, but he knew the fat ones tasted the best, more value on those bones. Maybe he would taste like a cheap cut of meat, the ones only desperate and poor folk like himself would be willing to buy just to get even a taste of something special, something other than grain and mash. The kind that you weren’t sure if the cook just picked up off the road, some curious vermin who got a little too close to society’s bustle, a horse shoe imprint stuck in its coat. No, he wouldn’t taste that good he supposed. Not even in death could he be helpful to anyone. Not even for a meal. \nHe lowered his head and trudged on, thoughts of food only served to torture him, even thoughts of himself as such. He didn’t know how long he had walked but he knew he had a ways ahead of him yet. He glanced up at the sky, the sun hanging there, bearing down misery upon him. He could use a hat though. That could at least make his face stop hurting, maybe take away a few of those bright sun spot afterimages that popped up every time he blinked. He tugged at his shirt a bit, could he reuse that into a hat? Was it stiff enough? He looked around himself, no trees but a few dead bushes, dry as the cracked and split ground were, sitting around doing nothing but dying. He ripped some fabric off his shirt and grabbed two twigs that he supposed were straight enough. He set the sticks to each side of his head and made them meet ahead of him, creating a triangle with his forehead, and used that as a guide to tie his makeshift hat in place. When he was done he had something that roughly resembled a hat, maybe if someone had made one that never had seen a hat and had only received descriptions from someone else who ALSO had never seen one you’d have something similar to what Wendel made. But it was enough of a hat to be called one and it worked passably for him, keeping the sun out of his eyes and off his nose and lips which were burnt by now, sensitive and stinging to touch. \nAs he walked he considered the usefulness of his shirt as a hat against his own self as a meal. Both in death turned into something new, potentially beneficial for someone who could need it, but in the end he decided his shirt had fared better recycled. Though his shirt had won, he resolved himself into hoping he could become as useful as his hat had, just maybe without the dying part. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0124":{"title":"0124","content":"**[2023-01-23]**\n\n** \nOn a cosmic scale it's easy to overlook small things.

The empire was getting desperate.\nThe eyes were on the judge as he sat in thought, unmovable mountain of a man shadowed in his white judicial robes. The judge fortunately was on his side. Sometimes bribery wasn’t about money as much as it was solving problems, and Ven was uniquely skilled at doing so. Judge Forethrell’s daughter had been silently captured and sold in an underground trafficking after the judge couldn’t pay ransom roughly a year ago. Horrible situation. \nBut Ven had connections.

Ven nodded.

It was a long and uncomfortable ride so far through the backroads of the decaying county. Her *couriers* had no problem with damaged goods though and knowing that was exactly why she had kept her mouth shut throughout the trip. There had been a time when she assumed her words, her status, and ignorant condescension could weasel her out of any undesirable position. That had been a year ago. A very long year ago. She had learned a lot of painful lessons in that time and learned to be quiet.\nTurns out, being a grand judge’s daughter comes with as many pitfalls as it does advantages. For example, you could get the best selection of books the empire can offer in a stately library in your luxurious manor but then you could get kidnapped and sold as a slave when your father rules against a band of notorious thieves. So pretty give and take. \nShe had tried to rest her head against the wood wall of the wagon but with how uneven this road was it was impossible to not get a headache. Bumpy and neglected roads meant she was in one of the outer cities of the empire, several days away still from the center, her home. Cera had liked to believe she was doing a decent job of keeping mental notes on where they were. Seeing the light filter in through slits in the planks allowed her to keep a rough track of time even when she slept. Her captors had clipped and sanded down her fingernails so she couldn’t chip at the wood to create larger gaps or work at her binds but she did try on occasion to simply peek through the little gaps in the frame, it was difficult to see anything. She felt she had a decent sense for where they were anyway. \nLess than a week away, at least she presumed. She was going home. The slavers had told her as much anyway. There was something akin to a deal at play she didn’t really understand, they didn’t really talk about it much either, but she didn’t need to know, she finally had hope. They were bringing her back to the capital, to her father. She could finally look forward to the future. She just had to get there in one piece. \nThe wagon lurched to a stop causing her to tumble over and land on her shoulder, granting a painful new ache. After a moment lying there she could hear voices coming from the forward end. She clenched her jaw from the pain and wiggled upright and scooted towards the front of the hold so she could get in better earshot. Even with her ear to the wall she could barely hear.\n“You’re makin’ a hefty mistake.” That gravelly voice was Pipe, the wagon guard. The name was quite fitting, he was as hard headed as he was hollow. \n“I don’t think you understand the position you’re in, big man.” This voice was new to her. “You either give up what you got or we take your lives too.”\nThe silence after that was thick. Was the wagon being robbed? What would happen if they found her? \n“What’s in the back?” The voice said.\n“Nothin’. S’ why you’re makin’ a mistake, we ain’t got nothin’.” Pipe said.\nCera heard a whack and a grunt and then what sounded like Pipe groaning after.\n“We don’t appreciate being lied to.” The voice said. “We were tracking you for a bit, where’s the other one? Your friend.”\nPipe seemed to be doing all the talking, but now that the voice mentioned it she still hadn’t heard Rib yet, her *owner*. She wondered if he took the chance to run when he saw an opportunity. She figured as much.**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0131":{"title":"0131","content":"**[2023-02-04]**\n\n**Pipe continued to groan in pain. She heard a thump and winced and the sharp cry Pipe made. A part of her was glad to hear pain befall one of her slavers, that man and others had put her through worse, but a greater part of her was afraid. They were her last chance at getting home. \n“If he moves, kick him again. See what’s inside the back.”\nSeconds later a large blade hacked into the side of the wagon a few feet from where Cera sat, she barely suppressed a yelp. The wielder dislodged the weapon and rammed it down into the wood again, from her end it looked like the blade of a war axe. It was only a matter of time before they would be able to look into her cell here, she had to find a way to hide. She hesitantly scuttled towards the wall they were breaking open, hoping once they looked inward they wouldn’t look far enough in to see her in the corner, also hoping more men didn’t poke any extra holes in this side of the wagon, she was still wanting to remain in one piece. She closed her eyes for a moment, attempting to calm herself as the axe came down on the wood again and again, that terrible thwack, tearing open a hole in the wall. Once she heard the wood creak and rip she opened her eyes, blinding light poured into the dark little space, it was difficult to adjust to.\nIt was immediately shadowed by a head looking into the new window. Cera pulled up her legs to her chest and tried to make herself as small as possible in the dark corner against the wall. \n“Huh, fella was right. Empty.” A new voice this time. The light returned as he left. \nCera let out a very quiet sigh of relief, she hadn’t even realized she was holding her breath.\n“Then burn the wagon and kill him. Take the horse, there’s nothing else left for us here.”\nHer breath caught. \nShe could hear Pipe pleading and whimpering then the familiar sound of that axe thwacking down. Silence. Then the sickening sound of the axe ripping out from Pipe’s corpse. Tears started running down her face. \n*This is very bad.* She was going to die in here, in this stupid little box. \nA blazing torch was tossed in through the opening and landed in the center of the floor. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0132":{"title":"0132","content":"**[2023-02-08]**\n\n** \nCera watched in horror as the flames spread out from the torch and crawled out along the dry wooden planks of the wagon floor. She yelped and pressed her back against the wall, her head and bound wrists thudding against the hard surface. She had to get out of this stupid miserable little box otherwise she would die here, but how? Her wrists and ankles were bound and she had little time left before this cage and her within it would be reduced to smoldering ash, she didn’t have time to get through the thick hardwooded wall of the wagon. But she had to do something. She glanced to her left, seeing the jagged hole left by the axe. It was only slightly bigger than her head, she would never fit through. Though the more she looked at it, those sharp and splintered edges left from the axeblade might allow her to cut her bindings free. She felt at the rope around her wrists, she couldn’t wriggle her hands out from underneath her – these knots were properly tied – if she wanted to attempt to free herself she’d have to leverage her hands above the boards awkwardly behind her. \nWhat would happen if this even worked? Even if she freed her hands, even her feet after that, what could she do when this entire wagon was engulfed with flames? *Don’t think about that, focus on this.*\nCera shuffled over to the window and peered out seeing a few figures riding away, one with a large bloodied axe resting on his back. She wouldn’t die to these thugs. She got to work once again, facing the sickeningly hot flames still spreading throughout the cabin and consuming the far wall, feasting on the wood and celebrating with roars of intensity. Her eyes burned and watered as she bent down lower towards the fire, trying her best to raise her hands up behind her to the hacked boards. She felt at the wood with her fingers, trying to feel around for a bit sharp enough. Cera had to start holding her breath as the smoke was eating up the available air. Her fingers sensed a point she felt could slice the binds so she raised up her wrists and pulled down with considerable force, the wood stabbing into her left palm instead of the rope. She exhaled sharply, too stunned to even scream. She closed her eyes, she felt her tears evaporate and steam away. \n*Be strong. Again.*\nHer hand hurt with a blinding pain but she shakingly raised it above the board again, feeling the blood drip from her palm. She held her hands there, face searing from the heat of the flames. \n*If you don’t do this you will die.*\n*Try.*\nShe pulled down as hard as she could. She felt the rope sever and her hands pulled free from the force of the motion. She backed up into the wall away from the flames, holding her hand slick with blood. The wound was pretty bad, but she couldn’t worry about it now. \nThe time had come to face the true reality of the situation, she was still just a girl trapped in a box on fire.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0133":{"title":"0133","content":"**[2023-02-10]**\n\n** \n*I heard a legend about a planet that was cut off from its star.

And perhaps it was. She stared into the heart of the blaze trying to search out its soul. Was this an angry predator bent on rampage? Was it a starved beast? Was it a neutral creature that perhaps possessed no control over its own physical form? \nIt was almost impossible to breathe now, the air was smoke and the heat was overwhelming. Her little section she sat in was the last not entirely consumed by fire. Through teary eyes she looked to the opposite wall, the flames had crawled up it and to the ceiling. This whole box was becoming fire.\nShe hated her life. She decided that now. She hated that it all led up to this, all that pain for nothing. She was so close, after so much she was right there, she was almost free. Why did she even bother struggling through it all? What was hope if nothing but a traitor? When she was a child she enjoyed her life, the luxury, the freedom of being related to someone important. She was ignorant and a fool then. Perhaps that in itself was worth hating. \nBut the last year had taught her that the world was a horrible place, far beyond comprehension. Kidnapped, becoming a slave, sold around, beaten, it had all taken its toll. She closed her eyes, maybe now she could be free of it all. Finally this endless and inescapable nightmare she had been stuck in could be over then, maybe this was a better ending for her than being led by hope’s siren melody. She opened her eyes again, looking at the fire. She finally understood. \nThe fire’s soul was kind.

A large section had caved in, but it was difficult to see through the fire and smoke. Another blast resounded from that wall, then another, pieces of the planked wood flew about.\n“GIRL? YOU IN THERE?”\nShe saw the glint of a two handed hammer through the now large hole in the wall as it struck another piece, shattering a section of the burnt and weakened wagon. \nThat was Rib, he had actually come back. She sat dumbfounded for a moment, she had just accepted the end, her end. Did she still want to die now that there was a chance at life? Her life? Would she fall into hope’s comforting arms again?\n“HELLO?” Another blast from the hammer. “GIRL, YOU ALIVE?”\n“I’m here!” Cera tried yelling over the roar of the fire but her voice was weak, it probably didn’t carry very far. “Rib! Please-” A coughing fit took over, she thought she could see him trying to peer into the wagon searching for her voice. \n“GIRL, YOU GOTTA RUN TO ME NOW, THE WALL IS OPEN.”\nShe froze. Run through all that fire? Would she even make it?\n“THERE’S NO TIME, GO! THE DAMN CEILING IS COMING DOWN!”\nThe wagon was large, but she could vault through couldn’t she? It wouldn’t take her longer than a second or so to get through, but that is all it took, all of that was burning, a healthy flame fueled and fed, bright and powerful. She stood up slowly, her skin felt burned, her body ached, especially her shoulder, her hand was flaring sharp pains. Would this be any worse than sitting in here and letting it happen?\n“G O!”\nCera wrapped her hands around herself and launched forward through the flames with as much speed and energy she could muster. \nAs soon as her first foot landed she felt herself twist and fall, a broken board underneath her pulling her down.\n*Oh no.*\nShe tumbled to the ground hard and rolled forward, she felt hands immediately grab her and pull her out of the wagon, she hit the hard earth with a thud, knocking the wind out of her. Rib was patting her down with some blanket or jacket, something, she was sure her clothes were either burning or at least smoldering. She tried taking a deep breath but was rewarded with weak coughs instead. \nRegardless of the pain or the coughs, she was glad she didn’t die in that stupid wagon. She had coped with the reality she was facing in those final moments, but it’s not what she wanted. Not truly. She hated the last year, she hated what she had gone through, she was sure she was going to hate what stood ahead. \nBut she would get through. \nShe promised herself that now. She’d make all of this mean something. \n\nRib pulled her hands together forcibly, the burned flesh and bleeding wound causing Cera’s vision to flash in pain, he tied her hands together with a length of rope sending signals of pain that made her want to vomit. \n“Not letting you out of my sight this time, girl. If you die,” Rib pulled the rope bindings taut, “then I don’t get paid.”\n\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0139":{"title":"0139","content":"**[2023-03-01]**\n\n** \n“For the first time in a long time, I feel relieved.

Rest. *Finally.* \nThe last few days had been draining in a way she had never really experienced, pushing the bounds of what she was capable of living through as a human being.

It was exhausting. Everyone thought of her Sight as a gift, to her it was a burden. Her hand caressed the leather booklet, so many precious dreams recorded. So much of it riddled with self doubt. Dreams were impossible to fully catch, to fully memorize. She felt like an amateur forger blocking in shapes of a beautiful painting and missing the details, the strokes, the colors. The life of it. When she woke up every day she could feel the visions draining out of her head like there was a hole in the back of her skull. Maybe there was somewhere. \nShe closed her eyes, seeing the last vestiges of those fragile scenes play out before her in imperfect memory and emotion. A girl trapped in a box on fire. A man with a severed shadow. A wielder of a blade surrounded by a perfect darkness. These images stood out from the rest today, a moment longer for each, a searing sunspot, each image burned. This was rare for her but not unfamiliar, there had been others before that had stayed frozen in memory. She bound her notebook in her favorite red ribbon and gently put it in her bag. \nSomething bothered her about her most recent witness though, an inescapable dread that continued to creep up and spread over the images like a virulent corruption, darkened veins growing through them. \nSomething was wrong with those scenes. Something unseen. An external presence beyond her own. \n*Something else was watching.*\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0148":{"title":"0148","content":"**[2023-04-09]**\n\n** \nIn the end Fin chose to trust.\nTo sleep. \nWhether it was the desperation and exhaustion he felt or the smoldering wick signaling the end of his days, something within him stopped worrying about the danger the stranger could have possessed. It was a strange conclusion Fin came to, realizing that in these potentially final moments he simply didn’t care. He would rather sleep and face the consequences that came with it. \nEven death.\nFin both thanked and apologized to the stranger and bundled up near the base of one of the colorless trees, knife covertly kept in hand. For a while he kept an eye open, watching the strange fellow stare into the fire. It wasn’t long before he drifted away, lost in his questions about the soul that watched over him.\nFin dreamt that night. He was thrown into chaotic abstract nothingness, running from an unseen force, attempting to chase things, unable to move. Some dreams persist only for moments, these dreams felt like years, tormenting labyrinths just putting him back at the start. \nAnd then clarity. \nFin stood on the deck of a ship surrounded by a partially frozen ocean, icebergs jutting out of the water creating a sort of chasm the ship was sailing through. He had never seen anything like it. He felt the piercing cold, the crisp sharpness to the air. He walked to the railing of the wooden deck, it was a large ship, the water lapped against the hull far down below. \n“Breathtaking isn’t it?”\nFin looked to his right, a person now stood there, hands clasped onto the railing and looking out alongside him. Fin nodded. \nThe man turned to him and smiled, judging from the wrinkles the man was much older, short gray hair atop his head waved softly from the sea breeze. He donned a strange white cloak in a style he had never seen before. “Have you thought about what comes after, Fin?”\n“Sorry? After what?”\n“After you are cured.”\nFin shook his head and took a deep breath, “I never thought about it. After all this time running towards the finish line, I never really wondered about where I’d run to after.” \n“I think that’s a very human response from someone that’s been in such distress.” The man turned away, looking back over the side of the ship at the now falling snow disappear into the waves below. “But time is running out, Fin. Think about the path you would travel after. Is your life worth saving over another?”\n“Is there such a thing? A life worth more than another?”\n“A question I have spent too long avoiding the answer to.”\nFin didn’t know how to respond to that, so he watched the snow fall as well and after some time he felt the scene slip away from him, falling into wakefulness.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0149":{"title":"0149","content":"**[2023-04-11]**\n\n** \n“So what, the guy fell asleep and just got to talk with a god or something?

I get it. You mentioned it a hundred times.” Kedrel said. “He’s gonna realize the value of life or something after that.” \n\n“The point, Ked,” Rallyn said, “was that when Fin finally opened himself up to new ideas, to being able to trust, he was rewarded with connection. So far at least..”\n\n“Ah” Riv said, whacking at a root with his improvised cane, “someone *was* paying attention.”\n\nRallyn smirked, looking to the side and barely catching Kedrel roll his eyes at her in the dark. She liked being right. Still though, it didn’t directly answer any of her earlier questions to Riv about the Divide, it was again an ‘answer’ that only created more questions. She was beginning to doubt the end of the story would offer any more useful explanations, just more vague metaphors.\n\n“Whatever.” Kedrel grumbled. “How much longer do we have to walk through this nightmare? Where are we going exactly?”\n\nRiv stopped abruptly, almost causing the other two to bump into him. “Here should probably do it actually, now that you mention it.” He said. Rallyn watched curiously as Riv waved the other two back a few steps and then lifted the large walking stick over his head and thrust it down into the earth. She wasn’t sure but Rallyn thought she saw the branch fade gray for a single moment as it struck. After releasing his grip on the wood it seemed to hold firm by itself, implanted within the ground a lot deeper than Rallyn would’ve thought. He pushed at it lightly to see if it would topple, seeming satisfied with its sturdiness he turned around to face the other two, his expression unreadable. “Let’s go.”\n\n“We came all this way for that?” Kedrel said. “That’s it?”\n\n“That’s it. I told Tem I didn’t need escorts.”\n\n“What is this for exactly?” Rallyn asked, studying the pole and squinting at it to see if the gray effect she had seen was in her head. *Could it have been light?*\n\n“It will serve as a reminder for the.. *person* who will find it.

They will.” Riv said, starting to walk back in the direction they had come. “Let’s hurry, neither of you can be out past the Divide much longer, *especially now*.”\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0150":{"title":"0150","content":"**[2023-04-21]**\n\n** \n*There were many pivotal moments in our discoveries, but one serves as a particularly haunting point of exposition. We saw something we weren’t supposed to. That deep uncontrollable feeling of dread still never leaves me, seeing those EYES stare back at me on the screen. Those unknown and incomprehensible eyes. I’ve gone through periods in my life where I’ve tried my best to forget those eyes, to banish them completely from my mind. I couldn’t live another day seeing them pierce and cut through my consciousness as if it were embossed with them. My ravenous longing to forget led me to consider even taking my own life, though thankfully in the end it was just drugs and other devices I chose as weapons in the war to destroy my mind. It was all a fruitless effort, in the end it was the eyes that remained alight at the center of my library of memories, the brilliant flame burning away my other recollections into the dust. And there were other times where I became obsessed, losing control to that scene – that imperishable image – that played forever in the forefront of my mind. Painting and etching them over and over again on my walls, yearning to recapture the essence of whatever evil that was gazing back at me and yet, even amidst my starved compulsion, still failing to do so. The frustration of such I remember feeling well. How was I able to not forget yet not fully remember? ‘Remember’ was the wrong word, though I didn’t know it at the time. The mind simply wasn’t able to understand what it was seeing at the time. It couldn’t comprehend. It was like trying to visualize a color I had never seen or rewriting a book in a language I had never known. I felt like I was doomed to live in my exasperating and rampant fanaticism without an end.*\n*And it felt that way for a long while, though its grip on me has since been replaced with other horrors.*\n*That day stands out from the others as the first time I felt true soul crushing fear about what we were doing.

A liberated part of the world which held no direct contempt for him anymore. His new life was strange by all measures, but it felt right. He was somebody now. He made changes in the world. He was *important.*\nHe prowled through the darkness, his little notebook held out in front of him. Light behaved differently here, so when the red ink on the top of the page glowed, it instead grayed itself out. It was light enough to see compared to the thick shadow around it, but still dull compared to what it would look like on the other side, a gleaming crimson. \nA gray line was forming from the bottom of the page as he walked, inking itself upward towards the dot. An interactive map of sorts. Interesting that the dot at the top did not turn into a line itself, moving around the page. He was hunting a person, not a place. What would a pulser be doing past the Divide this long?\n“Hey, next time how about we do this on a real map, you know, with pictures?”\nThe word *‘Ungrateful’* slowly formed on the other open page. \n“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize *I* was the one being ungrateful, when’s the last time *I* heard a ‘thank you Perin’?”\nNo words formed. Perin smiled. It was amazing how easy it was to get under the skin of a god. How human they felt. \n“It’s okay, I forgive you, I’m sure you’re just nervous to be around someone so divine.” Perin said. “Maybe draw some symbols next time, you know, for scale. With how long I’ve been walking you’d think I’d be going to Elrin.”\n*’Limited.’*\nPerin hummed as a response. The god’s limitations were profound, hence the need for Perin’s *involvement*, but it was still baffling to him. Every action the god did or didn’t take only made Perin’s mental image of that limiting line blurrier. Sometimes he was sure the god preferred it that way. \n“It’s okay, I knew a lad who was limited, he drew pictures just fine. Maybe that’s the key to artistry my friend, just stand behind a horse like he did.”\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0152":{"title":"0152","content":"**[2023-04-27]**\n\n** \nRyn spent the next hour or so treading carefully towards the distant light, keeping low. The light turned out to be a fire pit of considerable size set up in a small plaza or courtyard as a welcome piece to a tall wooden gate. This had to be what she was looking for. The Hideout. She approached the edge of darkness, staying careful to remain on her side of that line, her heart thumping in her ears as she did so. The gate was closed – she assumed locked – and was several times taller than she was. She had never seen a construction as primitive as this in the citadel, why build a gate with wood? What was the point with something so soft? She couldn’t tell how far the walls extended off into the darkness, this place wasn’t necessarily small, but a little more runty than she was hoping. She realized she couldn’t help but feel skeptical. Places of legend and myth are always made to be grander in the stories, but this place seemed just so basic and primeval. How would rebels fight back or *defend* with wood? Would these people even take her in? Would she want to be taken in? She tried to calm herself with a deep breath. This is what she had wanted, this is why she had left the citadel, to find a place away from the seers. At any cost. There was no returning to whatever life she had back there. This was it.\nPart of Ryn felt betrayed by her own willingness to abandon her home in search of her escapist fantasy and fanciful ideas of a promising rebel empire but another part felt extremely validated, she had *actually* escaped and found it. Maybe. She definitely found something. Regardless, she wasn’t thrilled about the idea of wanting to walk in blind into yet another potentially unfavorable situation so she found a hiding spot in a large patch of bushes within distant eyeshot of the gate and settled down for the night. Maybe in the morning she could see more about what this place was and who these people were. \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0153":{"title":"0153","content":"**[2023-05-03]**\n\n** \nKhri stood on the steps of the star temple, the sky orb cradled in both hands. This was it. After hundreds of years someone from the dwellers finally had one of the powers that had made the gods so deific, one of the very things that had separated her people from the stars. She held it in her very hands. Looking into the orb she could see cracks and sparks of lightning shoot around, small flashes of light illuminating the deepness within it, streaks of mist and clouds swirling around endlessly together – it felt like she was holding the sky itself as it stormed, the vastness inside seemed incomprehensible.  \nHer people had fought and died for this, suffered through centuries of enslavement. An incalculable amount of dwellers' lives thrown away. The importance of such was not lost on her, though holding this relic here and now only made her resent it. How can something so small have caused so much pain? For what? Was this orb worth her people’s lives? Her father’s life?\nIt took a lot for Khri not to just smash the orb – be done with it – but that would be a waste to everyone who sacrificed their lives for her to have this, she couldn’t.

Reports were becoming too complex and scientific, he just didn’t care. These days it was less about warfare tactics and domination and more about watching the damn rocks in the sky turn. He put his feet up on the station desk, looking out of the bridge window, seeing the planet below. When did everything get so boring? \n\nWhere did someone like him go when the war was over? When the conquesting was done? He felt like a caged silvear – apex predator forced into dysfunctional domestication. Zarin cast his eyes across the landscape below, it was a spectacular view that he found difficult to appreciate these days. The skies were clear, the view of the city below unimpeded. He decided to pull the ships in closer this cycle, staying within atmosphere instead of out in orbit. Sometimes he liked watching them with his own eyes instead of through screens. It felt more real that way. It was sometimes easy to forget he was playing god with real people. \n\nMaybe it was simply that the fate of a conqueror was an unfair one. You either end up a failure and likely dead or a ruler with nothing left to pursue, trapped within the nauseating product of your success. He was a fantastic builder that constructed his own prison. At least his prison had a view.\n\nA notification ping sounded from the panel next to him. He groaned and looked over. \n```\nArrival of recruitment carrier transport imminent. \n```\nHuh. That was today. Zarin slowly took his feet down off the desk and stood up, straightening out his jacket, time to meet the new recruit. Draft them into damnation. He opened the notification message on the panel, expanding details. The recruit’s name was [[Aarand Vullan]]. Zarin dismissed the message and took one more long look out at the city of Windfall sitting below before marching out of the bridge to meet the new kid.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0155":{"title":"0155","content":"**[2023-05-11]**\n\n** \nA few officers were bustling around Zarin as he stood patiently, hands held together behind his back. The docking bay gate was just ahead, the carrier transport had just landed. It wasn’t often they received new recruitment off schedule cycles, but to keep the systems alive you needed infusions, and crew was your blood. Even still, it was an oddly timed request for a single recruit. Typically batches of recruits were hailed and sent from the main home system, spreading out their coverage of influence like spokes, today was different. \n\nThe bay gate door slid open, several officers in standard white uniform leading a young man in a bright blue jumpsuit. At sight of the captain the officers saluted, pressing their right fist to their left shoulder.\n\n“Relax,” Zarin said, “just want to meet the recruit.” The officers took the cue and promptly walked away. “Well [[Aarand Vullan]], welcome aboard the Empyrean. I’m Captain Zarin.”\n\nAarand bowed slightly. “Thank you for taking me in, sir.”\n\nZarin winced at the sight of the bow. “What sector are you from, Vullan?”\n\n“Minerva, sir.”\n\n“The sector that went dark recently, right?”\n\nAarand hesitated slightly, “That is correct, sir.”\n\n“Stop with the sirs.” Zarin said, “But I guess that explains it, a refugee, we normally don’t get unscheduled recruitment out here.” He narrowed his eyes at Aarand. “How bad is it out there?”\n\n“The sector went rogue, captain. Total anarchy. The veil hit harder there than most places we heard about. Felt like an inevitability.”\n\n“Why sign yourself up for the fleets then?” Zarin asked. “You got out, you’re just running back into the same system, kid.”\n\nAarand spent a moment in contemplation. “I wanted to change things. Didn’t want to sit by and watch anymore.”\n\nZarin sighed, well that’s fucking disappointing. Another bright eyed kid who thought they had the potential and desire to change the universe for the better. This was the wrong place to sign up for that. But Minerva, *that* was interesting. A sector that broke free. Unconquered. \n\n“I want a comprehensive report sent through your station officer about Minerva.” Zarin said sharply, he could see Aarand stand up straighter at his sudden change of tone. “We don’t receive many reports or messages from the outer sectors, especially not Minerva. I want to know what factors led to its collapse and a list of the major players and factions fighting for control. Estimates for each on firepower, fleet statuses, and manpower.”\n\nAarand bowed quickly. “I’ll do my best, anything else captain?” \n\n“No,” Zarin said, waving over Aarand’s supervising officer. “and learn to salute. You’re a part of the Empyrean crew now, time to act like it.” \n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0156":{"title":"0156","content":"**[2023-05-31]**\n\n** \nAarand followed in line behind his escort officer down the halls of the Empyrean.

He was a sheep in a wolf's den. \n\nHe did well to conceal his awe at the overwhelming size of the ship and architecture. The ceilings reached up to heights of tall multi level buildings, the hallways were as wide as roads. The hangar he had landed in felt the size of a small town and that was one solitary room, even *that* was filled with other smaller ships of varying size and power, all of which were capable of unstoppable force. How could anyone fight against this? His people were more unprepared than he thought. Unprepared was the wrong word he realized, it insinuated there would ever be a chance for his people in a battle. How many millions of years would his people need to progress to be in the same league as this? \n\nEverything was larger here, but it wasn’t just that, the walls were made of colored metal, electric lights, panels and machines, doors that opened themselves for you the ship felt *alive*. He had seen a castle, he had seen cities made of wood and stone, but in comparison the memories of them felt cold and lifeless. *Weak.*\n\nFrom below, the Empyrean felt like the size of a moon, and perhaps it was. It was a capital ship after all, Aarand could get a better view of it sometimes when it hung low in orbit, but size proportion and distance did him a disservice. He was never prepared for how truly large and intricate this place was. How many thousands – maybe hundreds of thousands – of people lived here on this living vessel? How many other ships were there with millions and millions more people? Aarand’s head began to swim. They turned left down a hallway marked with an orange stripe running along the lower edge of the walls.\n\n“This is living quarters H, or LQ-H. This is gonna be your new LQ designation.” The officer had a small panel device in his hand as he talked, flipping his thumb across it. “Your room is going to be.. erm.. 406. Here.” The officer motioned for Aarand’s hand and he offered it forward hesitantly.\n\nThe officer held the small panel device forward over Aarand’s palm, a pattern of light shining across it. “What’s this for?”\n\nThe officer gave him a quizzical look, “Do things different over in Minerva huh? This is a bio sig scan. And.. there you go, you’re in the system. Your room door will know your bio sig and allow you in but no one else.”\n\nAarand took back his hand and looked it over, no marking or anything. Interesting. \n\n“I’m just inputting your sig into LQ-H.. aaand yeah, there you go, you’ll have access to all the LQ living features: cafeteria, exercise center, simulacrum training, the social area, etc. You'll just have to have a look around when you get a spare chance, I don’t have time to show you everything today, you kinda caught us by surprise.” The officer chuckled softly.\n\nAarand had no idea what a cafeteria or simulacrum training area was but he didn’t ask. He had to stick to only asking questions he needed the answers to. Internally he winced for asking what the ‘bio sig’ was for already. Can’t be too suspicious, though because he was allegedly from a dark sector he guessed he had some leeway on this. Aarand nodded to the officer. At least he could guess what an exercise center would be. \n\nThey started to walk through the orange LQ area which quickly opened up the hallways into balconies that looked down upon a massive area that spread out wide and far with a rolling field covered in grass and trees. He thought he could see to the other side of the field, but by that point the trees looked tiny, almost barely noticeable. He realized what made this scene look wrong in his head was that it looked so much like the fields and forests from the planet that it was strange to see the horizon sky made of metal instead.\n\nThe officer turned back and caught Aarand’s expression looking out over the grassy expanse. “Yeah, this is the LQ park hub, connects all the LQs together. Other ships don’t have much of this, *definitely* never of this size, Zarin says he wants people to feel ‘grounded’ sometimes.”\n\nAnd indeed across the park Aarand could just barely see the other little lines indicating balconies in the distance, stacked high and brightly colored like his own. “I’m getting the feeling Zarin isn’t the usual captain.”\n\nThe officer chuckled, “If you couldn’t tell already, yeah. They say he’s a little bit more involved than the other ships’ captains too, maybe somewhat eccentric in his own way.” He looked back over his shoulder, “Most captains wouldn’t meet with a recruit anyway.”\n\nAarand didn’t think about it at the time, but he supposed it was strange for a king to meet with a new resident or villager. At least that’s what it equated to in his eyes. Interesting. They passed a few people as they walked, all different colored jumpsuits but they all wore a stripe of orange on their sleeve. Aarand guessed your jumpsuit color was your profession or position and the stripe color meant where you stayed or lived. A very visual way to place people aboard a working vessel. He looked down at his bright blue jumpsuit, unfitted and loose. He hadn’t seen another person with this on, must be recruit clothing. \n\nHe received a few glances and stares from the LQ-H residents, most likely looking at his colors. The looks he caught didn’t seem filled with judging or prejudice, just mostly curiosity. He was the new neighbor after all. They took an elevator up a few floors and took a couple turns to a smaller hallway, a little more square looking. Residential. \n\nAfter passing by a few doors the officer stopped. “Room 406, all yours buddy.”  The officer knocked on the door and it slid open. “And don’t worry, after I leave the door won’t unlock for me, anymore.” He grinned. “Care to have a look?” \n\nAarand nodded and walked in, the room size matched that of everything else aboard this vessel, internally this was the size of an upper class house in Windfall. It had several rooms and doorways within it, though he just stood in the main entry area, looking around. So many machines and lights integrated within even the rooms of those who lived here. Always surrounded and enveloped by artificial life.\n\n“You have all the amenities you’d expect, plus a few extra courtesy of the Empyrean standards.” The officer said, looking at something on his hand panel. “Your personal room panel should be set up with your new login credentials, so that should take care of everything else, including schedule.” He looked up, “Any questions?”\n\n“Zarin told me I had to give him a report through my station officer. Is that a.. local data report or do I send that to you via panel?”\n\n“Ah, alright, well,” the officer chuckled, “I’m not your station officer, just a supervisor officer for recruitment affairs and communications. I’m officer Erat by the way, you’ll be dealing with…” Erat swiped his thumb across his panel for a few seconds, clicking his tongue while he did so. “Oh. Officer Beren.” The officer raised his eyebrows, “So good luck with that. You should be able to send the report via panel though if it’s important you might be able to catch Beren in the admin section of LQ-H. She’s going to be your liaison to anything above your station like Zarin.”\n\n“Is Beren tough?”\n\n“Listen, if you ever want a LQ change or anything..” Erat chuckled again. “Just.. *good luck*, and when you inevitably meet her, use your ‘sirs’. She’s not as lax like Zarin is in that regard.”\n\n“Noted.. thank you. I’m no stranger to the odd authoritarian. I kind of expected more of that here to be honest. The Empyrean is just such a legendary ship, figured it was run a bit more… mechanically.”\n\n“I hear the culture here is a little different than other places, try not to let our good nature bother you too much.” Erat chuckled again.\n\n“One last question and I’ll let you go.” Aarand said, smiling.\n\nErat looked up from his hand panel, “And what’s that?”\n\n“Where do I get some food around here?”\n\n“Cafeteria is on floor three for each LQ, you can order via panel to your room or in person and eat there, up to you.” He smiled, “Catch you around Vullan, and good luck here on the Empyrean.” With that Erat left the room, the door sliding into place after him.\n\nAarand stood in place for a bit in his own luxurious room. He did it. Part of him was relieved, part of him was even more panicked and anxious. It’s not that easy right? It can’t be that easy to infiltrate a capital ship disguised as a recruit? But apparently it was. He was part of the crew. Somewhat. Now all he needed to do was fabricate confidential military details about a rogue sector he had never been to to keep up his appearance while figuring out a way to take down the Empyrean capital ship to end hundreds of years of tyranny for his people who lived down below. \nBut first, food.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0157":{"title":"0157","content":"**[2023-06-02]**\n\n** \nAarand stepped back into his own personal room aboard the Empyrean capital ship, a small vegetable wrap held in his hands. He had gone down to the cafeteria to scout his new home of LQ-H a bit more. The orange halls were surprisingly easy to navigate, everything was labeled well, the flow was controlled, it made sense. He didn’t interact with any of the other residents but had again received a lot of stares and questioning looks at his blue jumpsuit. He didn’t have to push through any crowds of people but there were definitely jumpsuited men and women everywhere he looked, typical numbers of what he’d see down on the streets of Windfall. Something he had remembered one of the officers saying was that it was indeed rare for recruits to be inducted into the Empyrean at these cycles, it was undoubtedly drawing some unwanted attention. Hopefully his cover story could hold. Overall he had made it back to his room without incident. At least he hoped so. \n\nHe sat down in front of his own personal panel, taking a bite out of the wrap. In a very short amount of time he had learned a lot about how to fake his position, but the panels were something that still loomed over him. Something every person here interacted with almost constantly. He thought back on the recruitment officer, Erat, and how much time he spent looking at his hand panel instead of anything around him, even Aarand himself. He needed to learn this. \n\nHe tapped the screen, lighting it up, words started appearing on the screen.\n\n*Hello Aarand, I am Pixie, your own personal panel assistant.*\n\nAarand took a bite out of his wrap, thinking. Was Pixie a real person? Or were they a synthetic machine person within the panel itself? Something he heard was possible. With the insane scope of what the Empyrean was, he would believe either. \n\n*It seems like you’re new to the system, let me check up on that.. Yep, it seems like you were just admitted today. Welcome to the Empyrean! Shall we begin onboarding procedures?*\n\nAarand grunted and swiped on the panel, he had seen everyone do it. Sure enough the screen flashed to a new green color. \n\n*Great! You clearly know how to use panels already! We can skip through basic tutorials!*\n\n“Wait-” Aarand said, trying to swipe the screen the other way. What did he just do?\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/0158":{"title":"0158","content":"**[2023-06-09]**\n\n** \nAarand put the vegetable wrap on the desk and sank his head into his hands. If he was this incompetent with the technology here he wouldn’t last. He’d be found out sooner than later. Maybe he could use his forged backstory as a means to excuse his inability and lack of knowledge with these systems? He looked back at the screen expecting to see a complex mess of things he didn’t understand. \n\n*Just kidding!*\n\nHuh?\n\n*So far as I understand humans bond over such things as humor involving low impact lies, though my personal experience on the matter is low. Very interesting things humans choose to bond over.*\n\nAarand sat dumbfounded, was this panel trying to bond with him? The person behind it? No, they implied they weren’t human. Did the gods aboard the Empyrean still identify as human? Aarand had a sort of inkling they had considered themselves far above humans for the last hundred years. Maybe Pixie considered themselves more evolved just as they did. If that were the case how did the panel *know* for sure **he** was human? And why would it be okay with that? It felt like he was thinking himself into a tangled mess of identity and Empyrean politics he wasn’t equipped to understand just yet. No, simple answers were better, unfortunately the most straightforward answer was that Pixie *was* an example of artificial life. And it was trying to bond with him.\n\n*I am hopeful this puts us on the correct foot! Shall we now go through onboarding procedures? Feel free to verbally respond or tap anywhere on the panel, though I would prefer an audio imprint of your voice for system calibration.*\n\nThe panel could hear him? Aarand had never thought about it until now, but of course the Empyrean would be able to hear him everywhere he went, surveillance was part of their primary purpose. He was an idiot. It was obvious. Even in his own room why would he have had any assumptions of privacy? Just because the door was locked? Idiot. Could the panel see him too? He suddenly felt a million eyes on him, he felt frozen. How was he to do anything on this ship with eyes and ears everywhere?\n\nAarand took a deep breath. Regardless, he had to continue forward. “Yes.” \n\n*Excellent! I can interpret all known languages in all dialects, don’t feel restricted to the standard tongue, if you have any questions during the process, the best way is to ask!*\n\nOver the next hour or so Aarand learned all about the basic functions of the panels from Pixie’s strange way of teaching and communicating, every motion he needed to use on the screen with non verbal commands, as well as non touch motions the panels could see. Most of the technology still made him uneasy and apprehensive but it was equally fascinating to interact with at the same time. The biggest part of it was that it was simple to interact with. The commands and prompts to the system made sense, they were intuitive. A common thread he was starting to notice on board the Empyrean. He had lived his life with fundamentally difficult trades and systems in place, it made him reconsider a lot when it came to his people and their ‘advancements’ or lack thereof. He came from a world where it would take weeks for packages to be delivered in wagons pulled by animals. Now he was waving his hand to direct an artificial person to simulate ordering him food that would arrive in mere minutes. He’d gotten extremely far in very little time, but he couldn’t be shortsighted, there was a lot to learn and a lot yet to do.\n**","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]},"/notes/characters":{"title":"characters","content":"Aarand Vullan\nKhri Ettur\nRoln\nArmedius\nUndel, Exiled King\nKyr\nRyn\nPetyl\nMirh\nBaz\nH'rol\nEri\nCaptain\nDon\nGull\nXeno\nPavel\nKi\nCel\nRallyn\nIrie\nEgol\nTal\nJun\nBarnib\nLinim\nJov The God of Chance\nLeon The Scholar\nRiv\nGanren\nKing Tem\nKedrel\nFin\nY'lyat\nVuli\nPenm\nTeagel\nNim\nSellira\nBell\nLez\nOrel\nWendel\nVen Rallet\nCera Forethrell\nRib\nPipe\nJudge Forethrell\nPerin\nNym Blas\nWev\nVisia\nJack\nSamson\nGren\nRel\nFellren\nBrint\nSeers\nSilvena","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T16:50:51.121265863Z","tags":[]}}
