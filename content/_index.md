Hey, this is my little project of creating a public story a bit at a time, all connected with pieces of lore and in episodic/entry novel form. When I started this I was very new to this concept and writing in general, often finishing an entry in only a few minutes to publish as an alert to my streams (mistake). There are varying degrees of quality at the beginning (I’ve removed a lot) but the more it’s gone on the more I love how far I’ve come with it.

Currently reworking some of the earlier entries, feel free to dive into a few of the chained stories to get a feel for continuing stories and characters. Thanks for reading :)
