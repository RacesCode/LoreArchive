Cel noticed the statues overhead as they climbed the steps, the towering ornate stone effigies of a kingdom long forgotten. The monuments were lined along the mountainside, some were modeled after legendary warriors, some after the demons that killed them. The craftsmanship was immaculate, they looked so real.. 

“Don’t worry, they’re not going to move.” Ki chuckled, pointing at one of the statues, “There’s no magic resonating off of them.”

Cel turned her attention back to the path, is she that easy to read? The two returned to silence for a while as they ascended the steps, the only sounds being their iron soles clicking against the stone. 

“Hey Ki, how many do you count?”

“At least six.”

“That’s what I thought.” Cel gripped the hilt of her new blade.
