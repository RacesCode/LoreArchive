The power H'rol held in his fingers was terrifying. Reality bent to his will all with a simple touch. Legions have fallen to him, provinces and countries have been wiped from the world. He is a constant in this realm, he was here before it came to be and he will continue to be after. 
"What does he want?"
He doesn't.
