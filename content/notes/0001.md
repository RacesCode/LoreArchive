Khri held the orb in her right hand, the scepter in her left. A choice was to be made. 
Choosing one ultimate power over another, she never thought she'd be in this situation. 

"Go with y-your heart." The words stumbled out of the man's mouth before her.

She frowned in response. What a selfish thing to ask. He knows she loves him, choosing the scepter would save his life. But the orb would save more, their people, their kingdom, their way of life. So why couldn't she do it? She closed her eyes in aggravation. She was only a person after all, this choice seemed beyond her. Time was running out. She gritted her teeth. 

The man fell to his side with a thud, his strength completely lost. Khri held her eyes shut, fighting the tears. She used to think that it was so easy. Her criticism of the gods was not unfounded, but neither could she weild their choice. They were beyond human emotion, something she couldn't cut ties with. She opened her eyes. But that's what made her better than them. Her right hand let go.
