Bell marched down the corridor, studying the faces that flashed through the bars. She couldn’t imagine being one of these men, locked up in a cage. Pathetic. She looked down on them as she passed each cell, each more disgusting and filthy than the last. The faces of miscreants, the faces of people who lost. 
She would never lose. 
She wouldn’t get caught. 
That’s the difference between her and them, she was a winner. 
Some silently glared back at her, most laid in their beds, ineptly staring at the ceiling of their tiny little world. It’s amazing how quickly the humanity is ripped from a person once you keep them somewhere for a little too long. The sound of her bootfalls echoing off the stone walls was not met with as much inquisition as she would’ve expected, most didn’t stir at all. These men had given up. 
Each of these prisoners had potential once. A pity. She could respect some of these inmates' plans, some were rather interesting, but their execution was flawed. What a waste. She stopped at the last cell in the block, a figure sat in a chair, back to her. The wall he was staring at was completely covered with arrays of scratches, the patterns of such looked to her like a language she had never seen. This one though, this one’s plans were more than interesting.
