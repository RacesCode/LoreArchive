The days after Windfall's destruction were quiet. The people that were left alive stayed in what 
remained of their homes, barricaded in by the ash and snow. There were no heroes this time. No one left to stand against the power of the gods. Humanity felt weak today, reminded of its own fragility. Was this what they deserved? Had they brought it upon themselves? Nihilism spread through the veins of the last people. The light of humanity faintly went out some days after. 

“Shame. There was so much hope for them.” 

“Well Armedius, maybe you won’t kill the next batch hm?”
