Among the stars, humanity's desire to spread out could finally be stoked. A galaxy, Ysimji, had become the new home region with impossibly high levels of livable worlds. Many thought it would usher in a new age of advancement and growth. And it did. 
Humanity's boon had been fleeting however, a wave of dark space surrounded humanity's pocket in Ysimji, a barrier of shadow and umbra, a veil to the galaxy around them. Those who were stranded outside of this barrier were lost to time, only a few ever made it back within the radiant light of the new home sectors. Many had gone out, searching to break this shield, hoping to find the ones who were lost to it's darkness. Science had failed us regarding this, the cage we found ourselves in did not adhere to the laws we knew. Most had given up and quietly lived their lives under starless skies, cut off from the universe.
A dark chapter of humanity had begun.
