Jack sat down at his table, carefully setting down the ornate box. It was lined with chrome metals and studded with mysterious gems. A recognizable swirl of gold was present on what he had assumed to be the front. He had paid a fortune for it, all he had. Was he a fool? Surely the container itself would easily double his investment, it was truly beautiful and captivating. But what was inside? Jack ran his hands along the case looking for something to open it, touching every little nook, pulling and twisting on every little protruding element. Was this some sort of puzzle, a riddle? He lifted the box and shook, slowly at first, then more vigorously as his frustration mounted. He set down the box again. His hands were covered in blood. He stared, his mind struggling to comprehend what was happening, fear creeping up and morphing into panic. The box was pristine, not a single drop anywhere atop its beautiful exterior. He ran his blood dropping finger across the gold swirl atop the box, watching as it disappeared within the metals. His finger started to bleed more. He pushed himself away from the table and stood, creating distance between himself and the artifact he now felt very threatened by. The box just shook. He saw it, he knew he wasn't crazy, even now. It inched closer to him. He took a step back again and watched in horror as the box slid off the table and crashed onto the floor in his direction.
