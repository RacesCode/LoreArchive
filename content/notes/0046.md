Ki didn’t show any emotion, if anything on the surface he seemed more at ease. He heard Cel’s fist grip the handle of her sword, the click of the metal against her belt. Why was she so impatient? They were taught to be more discrete, to not give away signs to ambushers and pursuers that they knew. “Stop fiddling with that. Let them think we’re oblivious, just tired from walking.”

Cel released her grip, did she already give it away? She moved her belt around, swinging the sheath to her left hip. Maybe if they’re watching closely they would think it was just bothering her. She stretched out, hopefully showing that the leather tunic she wore was uncomfortable. 

“None are within earshot. In thirty steps from now they will be.” Ki rubbed the back of his neck, turning his head slightly to see behind him. “The ones behind are slow.”

“Can you tell who?”

“Take your best guess.”
