Every piece of metal here was rusted and decayed. Cel stepped past the heaps of unusable blades and armors, was there nothing to help her? 

Ki seemed to answer her unasked question, “These didn’t help any of these poor souls either.” He waved his hand, gesturing to the mass grave they were walking through. “But we don’t have much time, pick something.”

Cel frowned, just the idea of wearing an oversized chestplate that she has to shake a rib cage out of was bothering and uncomfortable. She found a mound of remnants to sift through, thankful she was wearing gloves. Maybe the rust wouldn’t reach something buried.. “Finally.” 

Ki smirked, “Fitting. You always seem to find the rare treasures.” 

Cel swung her new red alloyed short sword, feeling it’s weight. “I could get used to this.”
