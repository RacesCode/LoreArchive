The word spread like wildfire throughout the lands, a god was among them. A self proclaimed deity had taken human form and assimilated with their people. Was humankind to suffer at the hand of the fates? 
Of course this was all propaganda and misinformation. The so-called god smirked as he heard the stories as they were relayed back to him. The people here had much to learn about what their gods are, much to learn about the universe in which they inhabit. He just had to convince them of the truth, something that widely goes against tradition here. 
“First things first.” The god spoke. “My name is Aarand.”
