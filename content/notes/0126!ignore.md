Spending your life dealing with the Aurium underground, the dim witted scum that ran the streets, the hierarchy of black market deal and trade, it would be easy to think you had a grasp of it all. You would think that the folks most suspicious of being scammed were the cheats and liars themselves, but they end up being the most susceptible. Bell knew this. She made a living off of it. 
The connections she could’ve gained didn’t matter to her as much as exploiting others' webs for profit. There were others like her, sure, but they all lost, spending the rest of their lives in concrete boxes like these. 
But there were bigger games to be played. Bigger scores. 
She felt like too big a fish for her little pond. She wanted to play in the ocean. 
She was beginning to realize however that the ocean was deeper than she thought.
